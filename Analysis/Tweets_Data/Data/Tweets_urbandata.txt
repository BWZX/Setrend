urbandata	725763581636169733	2016-04-28T19:08:16	MaraLeeCourant (More context: residents living in those 3 ZIPs have different perceptions about nearly everything related to n'hood access)
urbandata	725762779039289346	2016-04-28T19:05:05	emilymbadger I think the combination of race + DCI, especially adjusted for metro differences in apprec., may reveal much larger effects

urbandata	725750333683675137	2016-04-28T18:15:37	RSGAT MaraLeeCourant Typically both, but it's not as simple as perception of safety to walk. N'hood context includes many other variables.

urbandata	699273359390068738	2016-02-15T16:45:35	alon_levy RIFuture How could town (municipal) boundaries ever be relevant to measuring economic size? 
urbandata	699272156576878593	2016-02-15T16:40:48	alon_levy RIFuture On high-wage jobs the HFD 4mi radius core=73% denser. If you also include low wage jobs, HFD=15% denser.
urbandata	699271133347110912	2016-02-15T16:36:44	alon_levy RIFuture I tend to think municipal boundaries are irrelevant. PVD core slightly denser by pop, but HFD core denser economically
urbandata	699269166407290880	2016-02-15T16:28:55	alon_levy RIFuture Back to original point though: # of higher-wage ($40K+/yr) jobs w/in 4mi of train station: Hartford 113k Providence 65k
urbandata	699267568033521665	2016-02-15T16:22:34	alon_levy RIFuture I generally agree- of course, both areas need core HSR lines. &amp;agree access to core as important as to larger catchment
urbandata	699266456706482180	2016-02-15T16:18:09	alon_levy RIFuture Even NL+PVD may be smaller market area, &amp; better served, than Hart-Pioneer. County-based metro definitions not helping
urbandata	699265780836409345	2016-02-15T16:15:28	alon_levy RIFuture If goal is simply access to larger market, both areas are large, but HFD-Pioneer probably larger &amp; farther from service
urbandata	699264580749496320	2016-02-15T16:10:42	alon_levy RIFuture No, SPG is part of HFD's HUD metro grant area. Route through anywhere near Hart-field could boost access to more people
urbandata	699237176614260736	2016-02-15T14:21:48	RIFuture I agree w/argument, but it's equally unfair to dissociate Springfield from Hartford as you suggest. Hart-field is larger than PVD.
