swinshi	714807793035960320	2016-03-29T13:33:53	ezralevin JHWeissmann if $1T over a decade is inconsistent with small change as pct of GDP, then my chart's in tension with TPC score
swinshi	714807430144782336	2016-03-29T13:32:26	ezralevin JHWeissmann ok, I stand corrected. Then I guess the disagreement would have to focus on the assumptions they use re ETI etc.
swinshi	714806576410923008	2016-03-29T13:29:02	Cuz it's like believing in God, or Bigfoot... 
swinshi	714805820928745472	2016-03-29T13:26:02	JHWeissmann if causes top to work less (eg), could get little less ineq and little more revenue (rather than $1T over decade)
swinshi	714805191602782208	2016-03-29T13:23:32	JHWeissmann I agreed it wouldn't change inequality or revenues much. Whether changes behavior diff question.
swinshi	714803455236390912	2016-03-29T13:16:38	JHWeissmann ok, but can't rebut argument abt taxpayer response 2 higher rates if modeling takes no account of response (Don't think it does
swinshi	714799797115478016	2016-03-29T13:02:06	JHWeissmann I don't know about work elasticities specifically, but ETIs much higher at top. AlanReynoldsEcn has great review
swinshi	714799465429876737	2016-03-29T13:00:47	JHWeissmann static score though, right?
swinshi	714795815982735360	2016-03-29T12:46:17	JHWeissmann I don't think my argument hinges on tax avoidance though
swinshi	714795583995834368	2016-03-29T12:45:22	JHWeissmann or raise much revenue! I don't think we're disagreeing
swinshi	714795324808802304	2016-03-29T12:44:20	mschmitt9 but the chart uses effective rates. If raise top rates today, affects effective rates more, wld expect same relationship
swinshi	714793006570868736	2016-03-29T12:35:07	JHWeissmann So maybe can have low ineq OR high revenues from top but not both
swinshi	714792893760856064	2016-03-29T12:34:40	JHWeissmann if top rate goes down &amp; ineq rises, &amp; revenues fr top rise, consistent w my argument.
swinshi	714792594677612544	2016-03-29T12:33:29	JHWeissmann I tried to make a better chart than conventional conservative one--this shows revenue *from the top* /1
swinshi	714792026261295104	2016-03-29T12:31:13	mschmitt9 doesn't change inverse relationship btwn top tax rates and revenue either
swinshi	714791820220301312	2016-03-29T12:30:24	mschmitt9 yes, but then we're in terra incognita as far as effect on economy &amp; revenues. Why one can't point to 50s for support.
swinshi	714791373405351937	2016-03-29T12:28:38	ernietedeschi but maybe this is what JHWeissmann didn't like too
swinshi	714791107163500544	2016-03-29T12:27:34	ernietedeschi unavoidable, I think. No one talks about raising average rates, but those are what count for tax burden
swinshi	714790743706103808	2016-03-29T12:26:08	JHWeissmann with my chart design sensibilities, I'm sure

swinshi	712756690811117568	2016-03-23T21:43:32	Put it another way, utility of models is that if they have a small number of assumptions, you can gain insights into the consequences of

swinshi	712751412216631296	2016-03-23T21:22:33	I'd love to tell you that this Auerbach et al. paper proves that lifetime consumption inequality is much lower than x-sec income ineq, but

swinshi	712667658865483777	2016-03-23T15:49:45	Paul Ryan's renouncement of "makers and takers" language is not new. He discussed it in a 2014 WSJ op-ed: 
swinshi	712626250255310850	2016-03-23T13:05:12	"In a fragmented media market, the basic test of policy seriousness may no longer disqualify a candidate." 
swinshi	712404348467339264	2016-03-22T22:23:27	Is this for real? A real-life Member of Congress wrote this? 
swinshi	712394043070750720	2016-03-22T21:42:30	And that's being generous in assuming struggle isn't simply correlated with unobserved stuff. Thanks for engaging jimtankersley sfcpoll

swinshi	712385747345678336	2016-03-22T21:09:32	swinshi 41% of Trump backers struggling-- 48% comf/moving up (rest DK or don't identify w/class). Cruz: 36-58, Rub/Kas: 31-61. +/- ~11 each
swinshi	712378564012871680	2016-03-22T20:40:59	swinshi In size of groups, 42% of Rep voters said whites losing out, 23% strongly. 35% were struggling to maintain class.

swinshi	712380555942305793	2016-03-22T20:48:54	swinshi JamesBSherk MaxEhrenfreund sfcpoll No, Cruz scores same across econ groups.
swinshi	712382054869168128	2016-03-22T20:54:51	sfcpoll ok, so here's the big q: which is the bigger group, non-struggling Trump supporters or struggling ones? What about for Cruz et al?
swinshi	712380172343894016	2016-03-22T20:47:23	jimtankersley JamesBSherk MaxEhrenfreund sfcpoll I guess was asking whether economics discriminates just as well for, say, Cruz support
swinshi	712377950029611009	2016-03-22T20:38:33	swinshi Education/race does matter more, white non-college 37 Trump vs. white coll 26. This was included in regression, w/other demos
swinshi	712377447401037824	2016-03-22T20:36:33	swinshi Replying to a few Qs - in Xtabs, Trump support didn't vary much by income (36-32-34 &lt;50K/50-100-100+). +8 w/white &lt;$50K vs. 50K+.

swinshi	712373661483663360	2016-03-22T20:21:30	jimtankersley JamesBSherk MaxEhrenfreund sfcpoll should've said little "good" evidence, which I still believe. monkeycageblog post good

swinshi	697480396292771840	2016-02-10T18:00:59	ernietedeschi RAVerBruggen in my example it will be 0 if post included to estimate it, -1 otherwise

swinshi	697480098069377024	2016-02-10T17:59:48	ernietedeschi RAVerBruggen I'm just saying pi_1, if estimated from both the pre- &amp; post-Ferg observations will be different from pi_1 if

swinshi	697477965353869312	2016-02-10T17:51:20	ernietedeschi RAVerBruggen ok, I think I'm wrong, but let me see if I'm right about at least one part. It's clearly wrong to estimate

swinshi	697471384792870912	2016-02-10T17:25:11	ernietedeschi RAVerBruggen it is 2 (=1+-1*0+1*1). So start over...Now draw the straight line across the V. That's their pi_1. Slope=0
swinshi	697470782243360768	2016-02-10T17:22:47	ernietedeschi RAVerBruggen 45 degree line STARTING at 8/14. Slope of +1. Make 8/14 rate=1. What's the FE after 1 month?
swinshi	697469620685418496	2016-02-10T17:18:10	ernietedeschi RAVerBruggen not at all convinced. Try this: draw a downward 45 degree line through 8/14. Slope is -1. Now draw upward
swinshi	697468665604669440	2016-02-10T17:14:22	ernietedeschi RAVerBruggen don't think so. Here's the giveaway--they say to get the post trend have to add pi_1 &amp; pi_2

swinshi	693802531756085250	2016-01-31T14:26:28	morganwarstler lymanstoneky I just suspect the regional price parities are overstated. Though zoning prob prevents the free flow...
swinshi	693802310787579904	2016-01-31T14:25:35	morganwarstler lymanstoneky I definitely believe there are big price diffs (I grew up in Maine, which is way cheaper even than Boston)
swinshi	693798707284856832	2016-01-31T14:11:16	lymanstoneky interesting--is there a good ready-made source for domestic migration diffs by state/MSA?
swinshi	693796787325399040	2016-01-31T14:03:38	lymanstoneky not sure I agree with that, though I don't have evidence handy. NYC, SF, DC, Boston are doing fine pop-wise

swinshi	693796344293650432	2016-01-31T14:01:53	lymanstoneky if people who prefer MS move and people who prefer DC stay, are there regional diffs in "cost of living"?
swinshi	693795952168189952	2016-01-31T14:00:19	lymanstoneky despite the much-higher "cost of living". Implication is that there are amenities of those cities not being captured. /2
