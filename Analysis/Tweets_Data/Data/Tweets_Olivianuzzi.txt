Olivianuzzi	708385036274372608	2016-03-11T20:12:08	Leaving aside questions of right and wrong, there’s a simple story of sheer and utter incompetence on the Trump campaign’s part.
Olivianuzzi	708379354280103936	2016-03-11T19:49:33	It’s simply baffling that a campaign would deny something that happened in a room full of cameras. More footage was inevitable.

Olivianuzzi	708310420516442112	2016-03-11T15:15:38	Completely agree with this Olivianuzzi post. Last night's "civility" arose from deep cowardice.

Olivianuzzi	708309789760229377	2016-03-11T15:13:08	Instead they talked about: how great police are, how justified people are in being angry because Washington sucks, the moon landing.

Olivianuzzi	708309386196865024	2016-03-11T15:11:32	Why didn't Rubio, Cruz or Kasich attack Trump over the violent culture surrounding his campaign during the debate?

Olivianuzzi	705583268217921537	2016-03-04T02:38:54	To be clear: Trump, who uses the same terminology to describe the media as he does ISIS, now has respect for the media.
Olivianuzzi	705582991209320449	2016-03-04T02:37:48	woodruffbets ty bb 💝
Olivianuzzi	705582833012776965	2016-03-04T02:37:11	But it's now up to Trump to decide whether or not the public can hear it. The Times has said as much!
Olivianuzzi	705582568217944064	2016-03-04T02:36:08	It was unfair for the Times to leak information about the off the record conversation, certainly.
Olivianuzzi	705582440639832064	2016-03-04T02:35:37	Trump says it would be "unfair" for him to release the off the record conversation with the Times, which makes no sense.

Olivianuzzi	705578854585389057	2016-03-04T02:21:22	Hahahaha what the fuck is this
Olivianuzzi	705577624379256832	2016-03-04T02:16:29	For example, he said this in response to Spy Magazine's needling: 
Olivianuzzi	705577456984563712	2016-03-04T02:15:49	Not only has Trump heard criticisms of his tiny fingers before, but he's also responded to those criticisms in the same way he did tonight.
Olivianuzzi	705576740157050881	2016-03-04T02:12:58	And apologies. It was primarily in the late 80s.
Olivianuzzi	705576339571675137	2016-03-04T02:11:22	This, from MarkAmesExiled:  
Olivianuzzi	705575455013937152	2016-03-04T02:07:52	Trump is lying: when Spy Magazine criticized him for being a "short fingered vulgarian" in 90s, he responded.
Olivianuzzi	705572554925350912	2016-03-04T01:56:20	Forgot how weird O'Reilly is.

Olivianuzzi	705570555848736768	2016-03-04T01:48:24	Karnythia this is a brave, constructive subtweet. My point was, things don't get accomplished when people don't talk to each other civilly.

Olivianuzzi	705563454720106496	2016-03-04T01:20:10	Karnythia TrillTessa but find the term so unfortunately and needlessly divisive.
Olivianuzzi	705563395697864706	2016-03-04T01:19:56	Karnythia TrillTessa a little creativity could go a long way here is all I'm saying. I agree w/ most of your points in the post you linked
