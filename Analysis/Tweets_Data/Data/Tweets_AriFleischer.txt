AriFleischer	708484032930172928	2016-03-12T02:45:31	A pox on both houses. Chicago is extension of left's anti-free speech movement.  But Trump's words were taunts. Leaders should know better.
AriFleischer	708467417069043712	2016-03-12T01:39:29	Seven top Republicans lay out how the GOP should respond to Trump as front-runner 
AriFleischer	708134792714391552	2016-03-11T03:37:45	I agree with Trump about raising hands at his rallies.  Some in the press totally distorted that.

AriFleischer	708118409897234434	2016-03-11T02:32:39	For all the differences among the four candidates, at least they're all for capitalism.  No socialists on this stage.
AriFleischer	708117903518932992	2016-03-11T02:30:39	Just tuned in a few minutes ago. Looks like it's insult-free debate so far.
AriFleischer	707393828492341248	2016-03-09T02:33:26	Other than his remarks about winning wars quickly and  then returning home, Trump has barely talked about policy in this victory speech.
AriFleischer	707393200021970944	2016-03-09T02:30:56	If Trump hits 50% tonight in MS, it will be the first time he wins a majority.  That's a big deal. His ceiling keeps getting higher.
AriFleischer	707271743191306240	2016-03-08T18:28:18	Never seen an attack ad like this? Then again, Trump is unlike any candidate; do supporters care about this tone?

AriFleischer	705606675877773312	2016-03-04T04:11:55	Since Kasich, Cruz &amp; Rubio can all say they had a good night, each thinks he can win. That means Trump keeps finishing 1st. Divide &amp; conquer
AriFleischer	705605931225194496	2016-03-04T04:08:58	I thought Trump had his worst night under fire from 3 opponents. But I don't think tonight changed the shape of the race. Trump still in 1st
AriFleischer	705605345922686976	2016-03-04T04:06:38	Cruz was strong and articulate.  He also got in some good shots at Trump.
AriFleischer	705605046571036673	2016-03-04T04:05:27	Rubio did a great job dissecting Trump's flaws.  His yoga line was hilarious.
AriFleischer	705604771865042945	2016-03-04T04:04:21	I think Kasich had the best night and came across very well.
AriFleischer	705600832935432192	2016-03-04T03:48:42	Trump again rewriting history. He said Putin is a "strong leader" and that US "kills people too." He praises our enemies and attacks allies.
AriFleischer	705600457142624256	2016-03-04T03:47:13	So when Rubio interrupted Trump, Wallace told him to stop. When Trump interrupted Rubio, Wallace was quiet.

AriFleischer	705596872744955905	2016-03-04T03:32:58	Kasich is channeling a Bush 41 quote: "We need to care for each other more and sue each other less."

AriFleischer	705593254239191040	2016-03-04T03:18:35	Kasich just rose above the rest of the crowd.
AriFleischer	705592157772627972	2016-03-04T03:14:14	Powerful analogy by Marco on the similarity between Trump U's promises and Donald's promises to America.

AriFleischer	705590864056340480	2016-03-04T03:09:05	Trump looks like he's sweating.
AriFleischer	705588463203131392	2016-03-04T02:59:33	Trump is wrong when he says military will do whatever he tells them. They'll resign before carrying out what they think is an illegal order.
AriFleischer	705587449112698881	2016-03-04T02:55:31	
AriFleischer	705585405165494272	2016-03-04T02:47:24	Trump is right on finding a qualified labor force to take seasonal waiter jobs. Most Americans won't do it.
AriFleischer	705584422867902464	2016-03-04T02:43:30	Trump's frank statements such as "I'm changing my position" is refreshing. Politicians change positions all the time, but don't admit it.
AriFleischer	705581757282840576	2016-03-04T02:32:54	That was a pleasant exchange between Trump and Meghan. How nice.
AriFleischer	705581480471187456	2016-03-04T02:31:48	Powerful breakdown by Cruz of the implications of Trump's donations. Well done Ted.
AriFleischer	705581123720617984	2016-03-04T02:30:23	No matter what, the problem is there are 3 anti-Trump candidates, all of whom make good points.  So long as there are three, Trump wins.
AriFleischer	705580752314998785	2016-03-04T02:28:55	Trump's excuse about why he gave money to Ds is actually pretty honest. Sadly, a lot of business leaders put access before principle.
AriFleischer	705579704724688896	2016-03-04T02:24:45	This is how you interview Trump.  Through facts and follow-ups.  Good job Chris Wallace.

AriFleischer	704037183427055618	2016-02-28T20:15:19	I'm not ok with Donald Trump's refusal to denounce David Duke and the KKK.  Of course he's heard of David Duke.  Trump has jumped the shark.

AriFleischer	697234480269017088	2016-02-10T01:43:48	AriFleischer museofhistory Kasich's good showing tonight is a mirage. He won't play in other states.
AriFleischer	697234590176559105	2016-02-10T01:44:14	SC's R primary is more conservative and more evangelical than Iowa.  It's tailor made for Cruz.
AriFleischer	697234187405946880	2016-02-10T01:42:38	As for Rubio, this is his big test.  Every good candidate shows they can take a punch and recover strong.  Marco needs a strong next debate.
AriFleischer	697233190809894912	2016-02-10T01:38:41	NH will be Sander's high water mark.  The rest of the D primary, other than some caucus states, strongly favors her. Hard to see her losing.
AriFleischer	697231633540378624	2016-02-10T01:32:30	My hunch is no one drops until after SC.  Several will drop between SC and the March 1st 13-state primary day.
AriFleischer	697230677557776384	2016-02-10T01:28:42	Trump and Cruz will stay in for a long time. One other candidate will, but tonight doesn't make clear who. Kasich?  Bush?  Rubio?
AriFleischer	697229607750254594	2016-02-10T01:24:27	If Christie doesn't do well in NH, where will he do well?  He put all his eggs in the NH basket and, so far, isn't doing well at all.
AriFleischer	697226011872731137	2016-02-10T01:10:09	Interesting: Bernie Sanders is the first Jew ever to win a presidential primary. In fact, the first ever primary winner to not be Christian
AriFleischer	697228732558393345	2016-02-10T01:20:58	The muddle in the middle among the mainstream candidates is a dream come true for Trump. They divide and he conquers.
AriFleischer	697226043330064385	2016-02-10T01:10:17	The collapse of Ben Carson is amazing. He is nowhere.
AriFleischer	697075994566488064	2016-02-09T15:14:02	I bet transcripts of Hillary's Wall Street speeches will mysteriously show up right after she beats Bernie in the final primary.
AriFleischer	696338886914674689	2016-02-07T14:25:02	I agree, but it was a bad moment for Rubio at an important time. In campaigns, you're either moving up - or down. 
AriFleischer	696336273729048577	2016-02-07T14:14:39	Chris Christie definitely hurt Marco Rubio last night.  But I doubt he helped himself.
AriFleischer	696178519597047809	2016-02-07T03:47:48	I'm sorry but I can't watch George S. talk about a GOP debate.  Time to turn the TV off.
AriFleischer	696178322255044608	2016-02-07T03:47:01	I just don't think it's there for Carson. Nice guy. But his moment near the top has passed and it's not coming back.
AriFleischer	696178290395111424	2016-02-07T03:46:53	Rubio erred badly by repeating the same refrain 3 or 4 times, but his second half was strong.  I think his "surge" will slow down.
AriFleischer	696178217892376576	2016-02-07T03:46:36	Kasich, Christie &amp; Bush had strong debates. The govs struck back. This debate isn't as important as all they've done in NH on the ground.
AriFleischer	696178011549392896	2016-02-07T03:45:46	Cruz had a strong night but NH is not his state.  He will only do well if rest of the field divides so he can conquer.
AriFleischer	696177912278609920	2016-02-07T03:45:23	As well as the govs did tonight, my gut is the debate benefitted Trump the most. He came across just fine and I think his NH lead holds up
AriFleischer	696173823180349440	2016-02-07T03:29:08	I haven't watched all of the D debates, but if Rubio is right about the press not asking those Qs, it's a great point about the media.
AriFleischer	696172766995836929	2016-02-07T03:24:56	Good answer by Ted on ransoms.  He came across as sympathetic, but his points were 100% correct.
AriFleischer	696171713676058625	2016-02-07T03:20:45	Rubio was spontaneous on women in military. All candidates memorize statements, but Rubio needs to come off as less canned when he speaks.
AriFleischer	696169192320593920	2016-02-07T03:10:44	Good answer by Rubio on a Mosque visit and his bridge to Little Sister of the Poor.  He's right.
AriFleischer	696168894449459200	2016-02-07T03:09:33	John Kasich does something odd with his hands, but I can't put my finger on what it is.
AriFleischer	696168049284685824	2016-02-07T03:06:11	Good for Trump for standing strong for the police.
AriFleischer	696167010179379200	2016-02-07T03:02:04	This debate is a jumble. The so-called mainstream candidates are carving each other up.  Right now, I'd say Trump and Cruz benefit most.
AriFleischer	696164751441862656	2016-02-07T02:53:05	I haven't heard the candidates' poignant stories about drug abuse before. Sad to hear about Ted's sister.
AriFleischer	696164032265515008	2016-02-07T02:50:14	I like Josh the questioner. Very straightforward.
AriFleischer	696162908720533504	2016-02-07T02:45:46	Interesting that Trump, for all his bluster, emphasizes he knows how 2get people together 2get things done. It's a reason many support him.
AriFleischer	696161835318439936	2016-02-07T02:41:30	Good line by Rubio about putting terrorists into Gitmo, not letting them out.
AriFleischer	696159011499065344	2016-02-07T02:30:17	Strong answer by Rubio on what he would do about ISIS. The man knows his foreign policy.
AriFleischer	696157807339511808	2016-02-07T02:25:29	Story of the debate so far is "the revenge of the governors"
AriFleischer	696157897475166208	2016-02-07T02:25:51	Christie is really having a strong night.
AriFleischer	696157048824819712	2016-02-07T02:22:29	Marco is having a bad night. He is reinforcing the view of people who think he can't stray from his talking points.
AriFleischer	696155111970570240	2016-02-07T02:14:47	Talk times @ 1st break:  Cruz: 9:13 Rubio: 6:25 Trump: 6:14 Christie: 4:59 Bush: 3:46 Carson: 3:37 Kasich:2:57
AriFleischer	696156210907762688	2016-02-07T02:19:09	Strong answer by Trump on how he would create jobs.
AriFleischer	696154151403831296	2016-02-07T02:10:58	Spare us the in-game commentary ABC.
AriFleischer	696153648053809152	2016-02-07T02:08:58	I'd say Jeb schooled Trump on eminent domain by citing the example of what Trump tried to do in Atlantic City.
AriFleischer	696153106065793024	2016-02-07T02:06:49	Trump interrupts Jeb, but tells Jeb to hush when Jeb interrupts him.  Trump knows how to dish it out but he doesn't like to take it.
AriFleischer	696150880677138432	2016-02-07T01:57:58	That was actually a fair and good debate about immigration and leadership.  Both Christie and Rubio made valid points.
AriFleischer	696150457169899520	2016-02-07T01:56:17	Prediction:  If Marco becomes the nominee, he won't pick Chris Christie as his VP.
AriFleischer	696148622728007680	2016-02-07T01:49:00	Christie is doing very well tonight - in a state where he must do well.
AriFleischer	696147828410863618	2016-02-07T01:45:50	Trump is right about China's influence with North Korea.  The problem is China won't use their influence.  They don't mind NK's behavior
AriFleischer	696146312450981888	2016-02-07T01:39:49	Cruz answer on North Korea was top notch.
AriFleischer	696146126504927232	2016-02-07T01:39:04	They forgot to ask Kasich a question and have gone to Cruz twice.  What's wrong with ABC?
AriFleischer	696145680742674432	2016-02-07T01:37:18	The Christie v Rubio spat just have Bush a great chance to shine - and Jeb took advantage of it.
AriFleischer	696145172770463745	2016-02-07T01:35:17	ABC needs to take control of this debate.
AriFleischer	696144996664242176	2016-02-07T01:34:35	Marco just fell into a trap. He needs to stop saying the same line over and over again.
AriFleischer	696144319238053888	2016-02-07T01:31:54	Marco better get his shield up. They're coming after him and Christie just made a strong statement.
AriFleischer	696143849706672129	2016-02-07T01:30:02	Carson is winning so far. (No outs. Top of the first.)
AriFleischer	696143109793718273	2016-02-07T01:27:05	Great statement by Carson on the Cruz campaign statement about him dropping out. That's why people like him.
AriFleischer	696142721036251136	2016-02-07T01:25:33	A smart candidate would criticize ABC for excluding Carly.
AriFleischer	696141682799210500	2016-02-07T01:21:25	Strong opening by Trump. He made a lot of sense.
AriFleischer	696141173509984258	2016-02-07T01:19:24	Too funny.  They exclude a candidate who should be in and the candidates who are in don't walk out.
AriFleischer	696140755971211264	2016-02-07T01:17:44	This is hilarious.  Trump and Carson don't know what to do.
AriFleischer	696136796049174529	2016-02-07T01:02:00	I hope Ted Cruz finished up his Iowa victory speech in time to make it to the debate stage tonight.
AriFleischer	695048512367640577	2016-02-04T00:57:33	Republicans would be wise to pay attention to this, regardless of the source.  The numbers are dead-on accurate.  
AriFleischer	695046778996015104	2016-02-04T00:50:40	Trump, who attacked Carson's religion, Cruz's citizenship &amp; Rubio's personal finances, is now complaining about dirty politics. That's rich.
AriFleischer	694894440410923009	2016-02-03T14:45:19	What happened this morning: Trump opened a newspaper, saw the articles were all about other people, and he opened up the Twitter app.
AriFleischer	694891160670728193	2016-02-03T14:32:17	69% of US eligible voters this year are white, down from 78% in 2000  
AriFleischer	694893654872363008	2016-02-03T14:42:12	Now I'm willing 2bet Trump is hurting himself. Many voters are drawn to his "I'm a winner"' style. Voters won't like him being a sore loser.
AriFleischer	694380429244252160	2016-02-02T04:42:49	Bernie made a mistake waiting this long. It's almost midnight in NH and SC.
AriFleischer	694379917669208064	2016-02-02T04:40:47	Ted won the caucus but lost the speech.
AriFleischer	694378602696171520	2016-02-02T04:35:34	Hillary is done speaking. Ted is still going.
AriFleischer	694377873218629633	2016-02-02T04:32:40	Not that I want to watch Hillary, but Ted is going on too long.  Time to wrap it up.
AriFleischer	694377480694665217	2016-02-02T04:31:06	Sanders should come on stage now too.  If Hillary can interrupt Cruz, Sanders can interrupt Hillary.
AriFleischer	694377106390847488	2016-02-02T04:29:37	CNN cuts away from Cruz to take Hillary. FOX stays on Cruz.
AriFleischer	694376887997566976	2016-02-02T04:28:45	Serious protocol violation for Hillary to come out while another candidate is speaking. Not that there is any protocol in politics.
AriFleischer	694375159092887552	2016-02-02T04:21:53	If Trump and Rubio split the more moderate/establishment vote, Ted will do well everywhere. But no one will have a majority.
AriFleischer	694374586880757761	2016-02-02T04:19:37	Ted's candidacy is based on getting conservatives who gave up out to the polls. Based on Iowa's turnout, he did it.
AriFleischer	694371569775308801	2016-02-02T04:07:37	If Bernie can't win in Iowa, or he wins by a little, you have to wonder how he can win almost anywhere else, other than NH.
AriFleischer	694368203988955136	2016-02-02T03:54:15	Not one reference to policy in Trump's remarks.  All personality.  No ideology.  He was gracious, but ideology matters.
AriFleischer	694367805282607104	2016-02-02T03:52:40	Trump being gracious is wise - and appropriate.  And since very few people think he can be gracious, this is impressive. But no policy talk.
AriFleischer	694364598691045376	2016-02-02T03:39:55	If Donald Trump was a Corinthian, he'd be number two.
AriFleischer	694363900444282882	2016-02-02T03:37:09	Very smart of Rubio to speak early and sound like a winner.
AriFleischer	694361806727450626	2016-02-02T03:28:49	Congrats to Ted Cruz on winning Iowa. But as Ted knows, the last time a Texan won the R race in Iowa, it didn't help him in NH. Bush 2000
AriFleischer	694359045113843717	2016-02-02T03:17:51	Looks like Trump will need to learn how to say congratulations in Canadian.
AriFleischer	694351603126636545	2016-02-02T02:48:17	If Trump finishes 2nd, I wonder if he'll answer his own question about how stupid the people of Iowa are.
AriFleischer	694346646986100736	2016-02-02T02:28:35	ralphDrussoAP But in politics, candidates with losing records can still run. Regardless of their grades.
AriFleischer	694344770446032896	2016-02-02T02:21:08	I wouldn't be surprised if Huckabee, Santorum, and Paul drop out after Iowa.  I think the rest stay through NH.
AriFleischer	694343962581143558	2016-02-02T02:17:55	Even if Hillary loses Iowa and NH, she will still be the D nominee.  If she wins Iowa, she'll be the nominee even faster.
AriFleischer	694335308154945536	2016-02-02T01:43:32	My prediction: Story of the night will be Trump v Rubio.  The press will say Cruz had a bad night if Marco is a close 3rd.
AriFleischer	692921341918461952	2016-01-29T04:04:56	Christie has great one-liners, but will it make a difference in NH.  That's his must do well state, or he drops out.
AriFleischer	692920978553376768	2016-01-29T04:03:29	Rubio makes good points and would be a very strong general election candidate.  His immigration stand got attacked, but he fought back well.
AriFleischer	692920492592865281	2016-01-29T04:01:33	Rand Paul was my surprise best of the night.  He was crisp, sharp and to the point.
AriFleischer	692920353774002176	2016-01-29T04:01:00	Bush was his strongest yet.  He probably helped himself in NH.
AriFleischer	692920136123224064	2016-01-29T04:00:08	Ted had an ok night. Not good. Not bad. He should have risen above the fray &amp; been more presidential. It's still a Trump-Cruz fight in Iowa.
AriFleischer	692919546278207488	2016-01-29T03:57:48	Nice close by Carson.  Can't beat what he said.
AriFleischer	692918917895946243	2016-01-29T03:55:18	Rand Paul has noisy fans.
AriFleischer	692913035254616069	2016-01-29T03:31:55	Great answer by Rubio on faith.  Faith is and always should be important - and respected.
AriFleischer	692912060481560577	2016-01-29T03:28:03	Kasich is back in his wheelhouse. One of the GOP's problems is many who struggle think the GOP doesn't care about them. Kasich cares.
AriFleischer	692910286815236096	2016-01-29T03:21:00	Iowa is not the best place to insult Sweden. 
AriFleischer	692910398115319809	2016-01-29T03:21:27	Another good line by Christie about the days of the Clintons in public housing are over.
AriFleischer	692909958501892097	2016-01-29T03:19:42	Go Marco.  Great takedown of Hillary.
AriFleischer	692909315175354369	2016-01-29T03:17:09	Ted gives his webpage for the third time.  It's too much. This isn't an infomercial.
AriFleischer	692908776421212160	2016-01-29T03:15:00	Good point by Rubio about the million immigrants who come here legally.
AriFleischer	692908390398431232	2016-01-29T03:13:28	AriFleischer Trump is in Dubuque murdering someone to prove his hypothesis about his popularity
AriFleischer	692908004602220545	2016-01-29T03:11:56	Christie's line about stopping the "Washington bull" is the best line of the debate.
AriFleischer	692907267327442944	2016-01-29T03:09:00	Very straight takedown of Ted by Rand Paul on amnesty. Ted keeps citing his allies. Rand argued about facts and authenticity.
AriFleischer	692905897505505280	2016-01-29T03:03:34	Imagine what would have happened if Megyn Kelly began a Q to Trump w videos of his previous statements and then asked if he could b trusted?
AriFleischer	692904212854902785	2016-01-29T02:56:52	Rubio should slow down his delivery.  He's coming across too hot, too fast.  His points are good.  He's just speaking too fast.
AriFleischer	692901514864640001	2016-01-29T02:46:09	Nice thoughtful answer by Rand Paul on Ferguson.  Interesting point about civil fines.
AriFleischer	692900625588203520	2016-01-29T02:42:37	Seems like Trump no show is weirdly hurting Cruz .... Cruz is better w Trump as foil.
AriFleischer	692899422401859584	2016-01-29T02:37:50	Strong answer by Christie on profiling.
AriFleischer	692897639730409472	2016-01-29T02:30:45	I don't think Ted is having a good night.  He's picking too many meaningless fights.
AriFleischer	692897388940251136	2016-01-29T02:29:45	Wallace is wrong. Jeb Bush's brother did NOT get us into a war in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda did. Bush defended our nation after we were attacked
AriFleischer	692895111743549440	2016-01-29T02:20:42	Ted is right that we have fewer aircraft today, but our munitions are more more deadly and accurate.  No more dumb bombs. They're all smart.
AriFleischer	692892421206593536	2016-01-29T02:10:01	For the record, my Twitter feed liked Ted's mockery of Trump.  Interesting.
AriFleischer	692892153983283202	2016-01-29T02:08:57	Jeb is high energy tonight.  Great line about Hillary and the FBI.
AriFleischer	692891134897467392	2016-01-29T02:04:54	That anti-Trump shot by Ted didn't work.  Too much. Too blunt.
AriFleischer	692890868202639364	2016-01-29T02:03:50	Debate opens w a 45 mph slow and straight one, right down the middle to Ted Cruz.
AriFleischer	692176632958828544	2016-01-27T02:45:43	Without Trump on stage, Rubio has the most to gain. Look for him to take on Cruz and make it into a Rubio vs Cruz night.
AriFleischer	692175914118074369	2016-01-27T02:42:52	Candidates can't afford to skip the last debate before Iowa.  Trump shows, again, he's not a politician. Probably won't hurt him.
AriFleischer	692134557492068352	2016-01-26T23:58:32	Who will win Iowa?  Cruz or Trump?   I'm coming up on greta    Tune in to find out.
AriFleischer	691045376757997568	2016-01-23T23:50:31	So far: Newark 21.4" Central Park 19.3 Dulles Airport 26.5 Philadelphia 17.7 Glengary, WV 40 Redhouse, MD 38 Hancock, VA 35.5 Windber, PA 31
AriFleischer	690937420209065985	2016-01-23T16:41:32	A Bloomberg candidacy would be devastating to Hillary or Sanders.  Here's to him getting in.
AriFleischer	688131763214798849	2016-01-15T22:52:51	This is hilarious.  
AriFleischer	688129477604327424	2016-01-15T22:43:46	Ted Cruz's next ad in Iowa - if it's not on the air already.   
AriFleischer	688126791160991744	2016-01-15T22:33:06	Republicans Have Overestimated the Conservatism of the Base  
AriFleischer	688065384742649856	2016-01-15T18:29:06	To those criticizing Cruz' "NY values" remark, don't think 4a minute that liberal NYers don't question the values of others, esp southerners
AriFleischer	688013525902618625	2016-01-15T15:03:01	benshapiro Explain why?
AriFleischer	688009904360173569	2016-01-15T14:48:38	Mark_Lopa Hope so.
AriFleischer	687855134747967488	2016-01-15T04:33:38	Trump and Cruz will be in the race for a while. The big question is which "mainstream" candidates drop out. If they all stay in, Trump wins.
AriFleischer	687854646430322689	2016-01-15T04:31:42	Kasich had a good debate, but I just don't see it for him.
AriFleischer	687854583058542592	2016-01-15T04:31:26	Christie did well too.  The question is how well it played in NH.
AriFleischer	687854479153049600	2016-01-15T04:31:02	Carson will continue to drop.  He did nothing to reverse his bad polling trend.
AriFleischer	687854345388347392	2016-01-15T04:30:30	Trump was Trump and that means he had a good night.  I give him a 60% shot of being the GOP nominee.
AriFleischer	687854124809887745	2016-01-15T04:29:37	Bush had a good night and was very strong and specific on policy.
AriFleischer	687853952419774464	2016-01-15T04:28:56	Rubio also did well and had an effective debate with a good closing statement.  Can he find a state in which he'll do well?
AriFleischer	687853798862110721	2016-01-15T04:28:20	I think Ted Cruz won, thanks to how strong he was especially at the beginning, taking on Trump over the citizenship nonsense. Good close too
AriFleischer	687851190659354624	2016-01-15T04:17:58	Jeb is having a good night.  Is it too late?
AriFleischer	687850712714223616	2016-01-15T04:16:04	I wouldn't mind a 1:1 debate between Cruz and Rubio.
AriFleischer	687847330993684480	2016-01-15T04:02:37	I share it so people understand the ramifications of anti-Muslim speech 
AriFleischer	687848950485790720	2016-01-15T04:09:04	Kasich is having a good night.  He really hurt himself a few debates ago when he sort of supported the Iran deal.  Not tonight.
AriFleischer	687846171566419968	2016-01-15T03:58:01	The tax debate between Rubio and Cruz was excellent.  No name calling. A good old-fashion policy debate.
AriFleischer	687844156987707393	2016-01-15T03:50:01	I enjoy the debates, but it's time for the voting to start.  Let the public decide.
AriFleischer	687838468622270465	2016-01-15T03:27:24	Especially in a GOP primary, praising the police is smart - and well deserved.
AriFleischer	687837836159012864	2016-01-15T03:24:54	Jeb is right about the need to work with Muslims to defeat ISIS. Not letting any in the country won't help us w our allied Muslim nations.

AriFleischer	687833233992495104	2016-01-15T03:06:36	Ted is right about Manhattan. It voted 85-15 for Obama over Romney.  Also 85-15 Kerry over Bush.
AriFleischer	687832763005681665	2016-01-15T03:04:44	Watch it Ted.  I'm a New Yorker.  But I don't live in NYC.  Although I was born there.
AriFleischer	687832541005385728	2016-01-15T03:03:51	One of the original two dealt with pay for Congress.  I don't remember the other.  And I'm watching something so I can't google now.
AriFleischer	687831961323188225	2016-01-15T03:01:33	The 2nd amendment was originally the 4th amendment and the 1st was the 3rd.  There were two original amendments that did not pass.
AriFleischer	687831416550244352	2016-01-15T02:59:23	Rubio is talking common sense on guns and how criminals behave.
AriFleischer	687828779658395648	2016-01-15T02:48:54	Nice job by Carson on right and wrong. Standing for values is always important.  (I still don't think Carson is ready 2b POTUS though)
AriFleischer	687828150047227905	2016-01-15T02:46:24	This is Kasich's strength - identifying with middle class needs and struggles.
AriFleischer	687827334263484416	2016-01-15T02:43:10	Marco shouldn't look down and take notes when someone is attacking him.  He needs to look the attacker in the eye. It shows strength.
AriFleischer	687825364282961920	2016-01-15T02:35:20	Take a cue from the crowd, guys, on Nikki Haley applause.
AriFleischer	687825437678899204	2016-01-15T02:35:38	Who knew a debate could be so much fun.
AriFleischer	687825105636884480	2016-01-15T02:34:19	Sometimes Trump's candor is really refreshing. He only raised this now because Ted is doing well.  At least Trump is honest.
AriFleischer	687824644410224640	2016-01-15T02:32:29	If you want to get under Trump's skin, talk about his poll numbers.   Clash w him on policy - meh.  Clash on polls - boom!
AriFleischer	687823803481587712	2016-01-15T02:29:08	Ted is on a roll.
AriFleischer	687821253361586176	2016-01-15T02:19:00	Interesting that FOX Business is saving Trump for last on the first question.
AriFleischer	687820595887640576	2016-01-15T02:16:23	Nice line by Jeb about Hillary going back and forth from the White House to the courthouse.
AriFleischer	687819144859787264	2016-01-15T02:10:37	My old boss.  Go PVD go! 
AriFleischer	687818291889360897	2016-01-15T02:07:14	Gracious and smart opening by Ted Cruz.  Sometimes not answering the question is smart.
AriFleischer	687054390977523712	2016-01-12T23:31:46	Top issue is our crew. Will they be returned as promised, or held to humiliate us?  I'm sure Iranian leaders are fighting about it now.
AriFleischer	687053809001086976	2016-01-12T23:29:27	Key issues w boat seizure: 1)   Where were boats? Iranian or international water? 2) Was classified gear on board? 3) Will boats b returned?
AriFleischer	687038049759432704	2016-01-12T22:26:50	On Iran, P3 crisis w China began same way.  Chinese diplomats said they'd return our crew. Mlitary said no. I hope it doesn't happen again.
AriFleischer	676973547261136896	2015-12-16T03:54:05	Wolf just scared me.  I thought he was about to say we're a month and a half away from the end of this debate.
AriFleischer	676973098596507648	2015-12-16T03:52:18	He does now that Rubio explained it.  
AriFleischer	676972874381529090	2015-12-16T03:51:25	I wonder if Trump knows what the triad is.  His answer sure didn't make him sound like he knew.
AriFleischer	676972636027621376	2015-12-16T03:50:28	Trump still hasn't shown proof he opposed Iraq in 2003, especially before the war began. He did oppose it later, after things went poorly.
AriFleischer	676971763448852480	2015-12-16T03:47:00	I like Christie's approach on fighting China's cyber hacks by publicizing China's info to the china public.
AriFleischer	676969853660618753	2015-12-16T03:39:25	I just thought about fast forwarding through the commercials.  I forgot this is live tv.
AriFleischer	676968736193183744	2015-12-16T03:34:58	Trump seems to be low energy tonight.
