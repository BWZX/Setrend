charlescwcooke	724679839983251458	2016-04-25T19:21:52	LeeatBruhl There is no health system in the world that doesn’t feature rationing. Question is always who is rationing, and how.

charlescwcooke	723223648597868544	2016-04-21T18:55:29	I think this is called “stealing the show.”

charlescwcooke	723177747586134016	2016-04-21T15:53:05	kath_krueger Although I think that the point here is that she was a freedom fighter. A gun is just a tool. Anyhow, enjoy your day.

charlescwcooke	723171651928633344	2016-04-21T15:28:52	John Brown’s actions do, of course, present real questions. But “the Marxists liked him!” isn’t an argument either way.
charlescwcooke	723171165624217600	2016-04-21T15:26:56	SorryToots I can be. I’d have supported the American revolution, for example.
charlescwcooke	723170358346567680	2016-04-21T15:23:43	So we’re fine with slavery now because Marxists opposed it?

charlescwcooke	722952474273918976	2016-04-21T00:57:56	PhillipsPasha Absolutely. And as recently as 2004, the party thought a Jacksonian would save it.
charlescwcooke	722951576609001472	2016-04-21T00:54:22	PhillipsPasha Right. The party has changed dramatically since then.
charlescwcooke	722950233328631808	2016-04-21T00:49:02	PhillipsPasha Understood. That's why I asked. :)
charlescwcooke	722949646625206272	2016-04-21T00:46:42	PhillipsPasha Ah.
charlescwcooke	722949370128310272	2016-04-21T00:45:36	PhillipsPasha But it makes no sense given my constant championing of the Founders.

charlescwcooke	722921472163979264	2016-04-20T22:54:44	Harriet Tubman was a freedom fighter in just the way that the Founders were. Same North Star. Same "promissory note." Even higher stakes.

charlescwcooke	722916710882373632	2016-04-20T22:35:49	Youxia88 Not in my view. In my view, he was a bad president and she was a badass.
charlescwcooke	722916352760143872	2016-04-20T22:34:24	gabrielmalor Ah. I was talking about Mississippi. Understood. Personally, I don't think NC needed a law on that.
charlescwcooke	722916055304257536	2016-04-20T22:33:13	gabrielmalor I've just realized that we may be talking about different laws.
charlescwcooke	722915851494666240	2016-04-20T22:32:24	gabrielmalor Because that's where the free association conflicts are.
charlescwcooke	722915353420926976	2016-04-20T22:30:26	Apkamps Maybe I'm not of modest intelligence. I don't want any more gun laws, and I'd like to repeal many that exist. That's my position.
charlescwcooke	722915180179431424	2016-04-20T22:29:44	gabrielmalor I don't think so. If it were illegal to utter racial slurs, I'd support a bill repealing that law. Would that be "anti-black"?

charlescwcooke	722914192693596160	2016-04-20T22:25:49	gabrielmalor Would it be reasonable to call a bill repealing "hate speech" laws a "pro-hate-speech" law? Isn't free association neutral?
charlescwcooke	722913658376851457	2016-04-20T22:23:41	Apkamps time and place restrictions, and instant background checks on sales  made by FFLs. Can't imagine we agree on much. (2)
charlescwcooke	722913365471809536	2016-04-20T22:22:32	Apkamps Difficult to know where to start. I'm against pretty much all laws except prohibition of felons/domestic abusers, certain (1)
charlescwcooke	722912328329637888	2016-04-20T22:18:24	Apkamps On what in particular?

charlescwcooke	722905952735768576	2016-04-20T21:53:04	Apkamps Understood.
charlescwcooke	722905217939820547	2016-04-20T21:50:09	Apkamps I’d also politely push back against the term “buy back.” “Back” from whom? Implies government owned in the first place. It didn’t.
charlescwcooke	722905093977145345	2016-04-20T21:49:39	Apkamps Not sure it’s panic-buying. Either way, that this is the reaction to more modest proposals shows you why the number won’t go down.
charlescwcooke	722903859274719235	2016-04-20T21:44:45	Winner. 
charlescwcooke	722903273871572992	2016-04-20T21:42:26	Apkamps I disagree. Americans are buying 3 million guns per month, and there are nearly 400m already here.
charlescwcooke	722902888809242624	2016-04-20T21:40:54	Apkamps We have those from time to time in deep blue areas (i.e. most full of anti-gun people), and they’re always failures.
charlescwcooke	722902477931085825	2016-04-20T21:39:16	Apkamps What are those?
charlescwcooke	722901998157176833	2016-04-20T21:37:21	_Almaqah It’s also an incredibly stupid argument. Is Lincoln’s Birthday “tricky” because slaveowners gained days off by owning slaves?

charlescwcooke	722892293322121216	2016-04-20T20:58:48	subtlerfugue vongillern The argument is that the process sometimes yields false verdicts so killing the suspect is therefore a bad idea.

charlescwcooke	706922069146128385	2016-03-07T19:18:49	Meanwhile in FL, Cruz is at 17, 21 points behind Trump.

charlescwcooke	706904640357605376	2016-03-07T18:09:34	Good question from jasonahart: Why hasn’t Rubio laid a finger on Kasich, especially on Obamacare?
charlescwcooke	706904416876687361	2016-03-07T18:08:41	How about this for a compromise? I write what I want, and you f--- right off?  
charlescwcooke	706904469506801665	2016-03-07T18:08:53	j_henry2 I agree.
charlescwcooke	706904067289849858	2016-03-07T18:07:17	jasonahart EricaGrieder Why won’t he do it?
charlescwcooke	706903067749453825	2016-03-07T18:03:19	charlescwcooke EricaGrieder and dressing down Kasich's OCare support would make Kasich pitch a fit, while advancing Rubio's own message...
charlescwcooke	706903378937438208	2016-03-07T18:04:33	Sure. Jeb hurt Rubio a lot. And Rubio’s had a crowded field. But he had a chance to narrow it, and he messed up. 
charlescwcooke	706902705307066368	2016-03-07T18:01:53	Right. Rubio really hurt himself. 
charlescwcooke	706902369481707520	2016-03-07T18:00:33	And vice-versa. 
charlescwcooke	706887928719548416	2016-03-07T17:03:10	wbradhelms Popehat He means that the ruling was narrowly tailored.
charlescwcooke	706886799533195264	2016-03-07T16:58:40	MattCover It’s getting a little late for that, especially as Kasich is still in the race and starting to do well.
charlescwcooke	706886466417217536	2016-03-07T16:57:21	"Supreme Court decides case narrowly under elementary Full Faith and Credit Clause precedent" doesn't create clicks. 
charlescwcooke	706886214503305216	2016-03-07T16:56:21	TheStalwart That’s why I said theoretically. But if Kasich loses Ohio and Rubio wins FL, it could change. Trump knows that.
charlescwcooke	706885838962073600	2016-03-07T16:54:51	TheStalwart Is it? Theoretically—theoretically!—Rubio should do well in upcoming states. If he wins FL, he’s a thorn for both of them.

charlescwcooke	706882451373576192	2016-03-07T16:41:24	Looking like Cruz guessed right in the prisoner’s dilemma and Rubio guessed wrong.

charlescwcooke	703631489758535680	2016-02-27T17:23:14	afzamarro freddoso I have quite literally pushed back against the conflation of Trump and his supporters:

charlescwcooke	703627695037550594	2016-02-27T17:08:09	afzamarro freddoso Not really. I’m making your point by noting that the arguments being forwarded are convenient excuses.

charlescwcooke	703621076073390081	2016-02-27T16:41:51	Candidates for Congress, governor, Senate could campaign with this person instead of sullying themselves with Trump. Will someone step up?
charlescwcooke	703620807558205440	2016-02-27T16:40:47	Anyway, if the hostile takeover succeeds, there will a market for a 3rd man (or woman). GOP candidates down-ticket will need it, in fact.
charlescwcooke	703619999450210304	2016-02-27T16:37:35	freddoso Obama is a cynical, divisive, media-driven celebrity who doesn’t respect political norms. We can fix that with Trump.
charlescwcooke	703619537590157312	2016-02-27T16:35:45	freddoso Also important to remember that the Constitution matters, except for Obama’s veto, which could be ignored if the GOP cared enough.
charlescwcooke	703618036016783361	2016-02-27T16:29:47	freddoso We must hit GOP for not defunding PP, repealing Obamacare, or balancing the budget by electing a guy who pre-caved on all three.

charlescwcooke	703577114163937280	2016-02-27T13:47:10	Excellent point. Again: the key date is 3/15, not 3/1. Trump will do well on Tuesday, but nil desperandum. 
charlescwcooke	703573856104095745	2016-02-27T13:34:13	Trump, on Fox, says Christie called him out of the blue to offer his endorsement, which does not appear to be true.

charlescwcooke	703051392483627008	2016-02-26T02:58:08	Trump expresses displeasure that he's being asked too many questions. Best sign yet of how tonight is going.

charlescwcooke	703047220862578688	2016-02-26T02:41:34	I mean, Rubio just stood there smirking at Trump's attempt to explain health policy, then mocked him to his face on TV. Wow. GOPDebate

charlescwcooke	702203568317669378	2016-02-23T18:49:11	So either ACU isn't telling the truth or AlexConant isn't. Or some serious word parsing: 
charlescwcooke	702202345086521344	2016-02-23T18:44:20	ZeevKidron Yes. But he won’t. Cruz is his biggest threat on Super Tuesday. So he wants to destroy him first, then destroy Rubio.
charlescwcooke	702201234749427712	2016-02-23T18:39:55	Did mschlapp's @acuconservativ mislead Breitbart about Rubio skipping CPAC? Rubio camp: we never said no

charlescwcooke	702197695075717121	2016-02-23T18:25:51	I suspect this is Breitbart taking “we haven’t worked out our March schedule yet” and transmuting it into “!!!!!!”

charlescwcooke	702129602756485120	2016-02-23T13:55:16	DrewMTips Understood.
charlescwcooke	702129090363584512	2016-02-23T13:53:14	DrewMTips Nobody disputes that. But you were implying that Kasich’s counter would be strong, and you have now conceded that it’s not.
charlescwcooke	702128198155427840	2016-02-23T13:49:42	DrewMTips Sure he does. In your hypothetical he was being asked to drop out by people who acknowledge the same reality you just did.
charlescwcooke	702127780495015936	2016-02-23T13:48:02	DrewMTips I’ll ignore your “second coming” crap. Kasich is not stupid. He can see that “but Ohio!” isn’t a good argument.
charlescwcooke	702127432262881280	2016-02-23T13:46:39	DrewMTips Maybe. But that has nothing to do with your point.
charlescwcooke	702127354135580676	2016-02-23T13:46:20	DrewMTips Then you do understand the case for Kasich’s leaving, and why it’s superior to Kasich’s staying.
charlescwcooke	702127119262994433	2016-02-23T13:45:24	DrewMTips Who has the better shot? That’s the only important question. If nobody, then Kasich staying in makes no sense.

charlescwcooke	701899837709615105	2016-02-22T22:42:16	Why? Because Biden—the incumbent VP—is making the exact case that Mitch McConnell is making, and at length. Hilarious.
charlescwcooke	701899322875650049	2016-02-22T22:40:13	As ever, my view is that POTUS can nominate whomever he likes and Senate can do whatever it wants. But Biden’s comments couldn’t be worse.
charlescwcooke	701898758280372224	2016-02-22T22:37:59	If it’s outrageous to argue outgoing presidents shouldn’t nominate, what about those running for re-election? 
charlescwcooke	701898407389097984	2016-02-22T22:36:35	Worth noting that Biden said here what is apparently inexcusable: that POTUS *shouldn’t even name anybody*. 
charlescwcooke	701897489813782529	2016-02-22T22:32:56	Revolution, 1800 election, Civil War, Reconstruction, late 1960s—all breezes compared to now. Halcyon days, even.

charlescwcooke	701852322230566912	2016-02-22T19:33:28	This “mistake” was akin to lawyers saying things they know will be struck simply to get them into the jury’s head. 
charlescwcooke	701850178572181504	2016-02-22T19:24:56	BresPolitico There’s no “election year standard” in my view. I’m just going by Biden’s own logic.
charlescwcooke	701847977355247617	2016-02-22T19:16:12	His argument was “once the political season is underway . . .” We’re three primaries in. By his standard, it is. 
charlescwcooke	701847526111125506	2016-02-22T19:14:24	bljacka cspan This is begging the question.

charlescwcooke	701841057139580928	2016-02-22T18:48:42	bljacka cspan We completely disagree.
charlescwcooke	701840803451240448	2016-02-22T18:47:41	bljacka cspan You said Schumer was wrong. That was Schumer’s only claim.
charlescwcooke	701839997570301954	2016-02-22T18:44:29	bljacka cspan No, Schumer was right. Senate can do what it wants. What’s wrong is justifying the block with “it’s an election year.”
charlescwcooke	701838805817540610	2016-02-22T18:39:45	Actually, the criticism is the same: lack of objectivity, obvious fluffing.

charlescwcooke	701423289021784068	2016-02-21T15:08:38	After this weekend it’s clear that Clinton, Trump and Rubio look stronger, while Cruz and Sanders look weaker

charlescwcooke	701230491593084930	2016-02-21T02:22:32	Nota bene: the reason people think that other folks dropping out helps Rubio is that that’s what polls show. 
charlescwcooke	701230314086129666	2016-02-21T02:21:49	Rubio talking about people other than entrepreneurs, which is good. He did that in his announcement speech, then backed off a touch.
