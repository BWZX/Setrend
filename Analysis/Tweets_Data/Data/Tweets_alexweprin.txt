alexweprin	697469670576750592	2016-02-10T17:18:22	tim_bays Schwindter One issue, I think, is that HBO still reliant on pay-TV partners for marketing of core service.

alexweprin	697463127319904256	2016-02-10T16:52:22	Another way to look at it  Paying subscribers:  Hulu: 9 million HBO: 65(ish) million Netflix: 75 million 
alexweprin	697462518923583488	2016-02-10T16:49:57	100% accurate, but not apples to apples because most people still buy HBO through their pay-TV provider 
alexweprin	697457256120590336	2016-02-10T16:29:02	jgreco Fair. Somewhere between zero and 60 million people.
alexweprin	697456420174876672	2016-02-10T16:25:43	jgreco I get it, but its complicated by the fact that most subs still come from pay-TV. More than 60M people pay monthly for HBO.
alexweprin	697455650499121152	2016-02-10T16:22:39	So, HBO added 2.7M subscribers last year, we can say around 800,000 of those subs were for HBO Now.
