ModeledBehavior	721721018470047744	2016-04-17T15:24:34	rortybomb ... In a world with mass productivity gains, that may be first best. But the automation w/out gains would be a problem.
ModeledBehavior	721720500024713216	2016-04-17T15:22:30	rortybomb it is possible to imagine a world where lacking a job is a vacation. Policies needed to get that would be contractionary...

ModeledBehavior	721717135265939456	2016-04-17T15:09:08	rortybomb no because I think government leans against employment of low skilled people in many ways

ModeledBehavior	721716377002905604	2016-04-17T15:06:07	rortybomb so we'd need a UBI. But to fund that would require massive capital gains tax, which would increase costs and lower output then.

ModeledBehavior	718827765454217216	2016-04-09T15:47:49	Chris_arnade so if TBTF was credibly removed (I don't believe it can be, but hypothetically speaking) would citi break up for profit?

ModeledBehavior	718826575911849984	2016-04-09T15:43:05	Chris_arnade I agree with that.
ModeledBehavior	718826416775761921	2016-04-09T15:42:27	Chris_arnade ...but I think this needs a theory of the market failure that allows sub-optimal management. Don't firms want to max profit?
ModeledBehavior	718826242552832001	2016-04-09T15:41:46	Chris_arnade I agree if it increases self-inflicted that can be a "market failure" of sorts given importance of finance to the economy...
ModeledBehavior	718825200851271681	2016-04-09T15:37:37	Chris_arnade so I understand you correctly, you mean basically whether consolidation increases total risk in the economy somehow?
ModeledBehavior	718823961061154817	2016-04-09T15:32:42	Chris_arnade but if some other bank organization was simply more profitable, competitive forces should produce it. So what market failure?
ModeledBehavior	718823720568168448	2016-04-09T15:31:44	Chris_arnade lobbying, TBTF, the market failure that would keep competitive equilibrium from being optimal is obvious there...
ModeledBehavior	718821750386114561	2016-04-09T15:23:55	Chris_arnade why would there be a market failure here?
ModeledBehavior	718816590385561604	2016-04-09T15:03:24	Chris_arnade and are ten small banks that fail less of a problem than one big one?

ModeledBehavior	710846692644491264	2016-03-18T15:13:53	lymanstoneky this is why I said that high vacancies can be a cost of migration, not that they are always an everywhere so.

ModeledBehavior	710845940924600321	2016-03-18T15:10:53	lymanstoneky there is a vast literature here. Hartley has an interesting approach 
ModeledBehavior	710844752841854976	2016-03-18T15:06:10	lymanstoneky no you can precisely observe the effects of marginal blight on nearby house prices microspatially. It's causal.
ModeledBehavior	710843807907106816	2016-03-18T15:02:25	lymanstoneky outmigration can create huge empty areas, yes.
ModeledBehavior	710843009160630272	2016-03-18T14:59:14	lymanstoneky well it's easier to break into and trash an empty house. And surveillance is hard when vacancies accumulate.
ModeledBehavior	710842531584610304	2016-03-18T14:57:21	lymanstoneky blight means an empty house gets windows smashed in, draws crime and physical garbage, yards overgrown, and a fire risk.
ModeledBehavior	710841650889801735	2016-03-18T14:53:51	lymanstoneky you are failing to distinguish between blight and supply effects on prices.
ModeledBehavior	710840866299056128	2016-03-18T14:50:43	lymanstoneky if cheap real estate were a sufficient condition then post-industrial town would be doing a lot better on average.

ModeledBehavior	710840525356662784	2016-03-18T14:49:22	lymanstoneky for one thing we're talking about who bears costs not efficiency. And blight is an externality.
ModeledBehavior	710839798785773569	2016-03-18T14:46:29	lymanstoneky housing vacancy is a cost to stayers who own, and it is when it blights neighborhoods.
ModeledBehavior	710839615570190337	2016-03-18T14:45:45	lymanstoneky its simply undeniable that declining populations have made legacy debts far more of a problem.
ModeledBehavior	710839264389566464	2016-03-18T14:44:22	lymanstoneky yes, Pittsburgh is a success story of responding to economic shocks. It shrunk some, but shows past booms aren't death.

ModeledBehavior	710817215310864384	2016-03-18T13:16:45	lymanstoneky I also think you're way to sanguine about "legacy costs". Many places simply won't get out from under pension debt...
ModeledBehavior	710817006304546816	2016-03-18T13:15:55	lymanstoneky this is especially true if the ppl who leave are high skilled, which can be complimentary to low-skilled.

ModeledBehavior	710411432538411008	2016-03-17T10:24:18	lymanstoneky JedKolko low hiring reflects low demand not elasticity. Equilibrium point versus slope

ModeledBehavior	710410758891376641	2016-03-17T10:21:38	lymanstoneky JedKolko u assume great hiring for sale shift in labor supply

ModeledBehavior	710409061959749632	2016-03-17T10:14:53	lymanstoneky JedKolko that's an anecdote, but struggling places are disproportionately low wage places
ModeledBehavior	710408267168555008	2016-03-17T10:11:44	lymanstoneky JedKolko I mean if it makes it easier to stay in high unemployed areas that would reduce migration

ModeledBehavior	710407764871282688	2016-03-17T10:09:44	lymanstoneky JedKolko ... workers that encourage work will also help. The EITC benefits struggling communities disproportionately.
ModeledBehavior	710407621258272770	2016-03-17T10:09:10	lymanstoneky JedKolko but there is also big differences in governance, and better governance can help. General subsidies for low income...

ModeledBehavior	688209483965665280	2016-01-16T04:01:41	So in business cycles, growth, &amp; finance, relatively high-end econometrics has changed my views &amp; the views of many other economists. ~fin~
ModeledBehavior	688207273907191809	2016-01-16T03:52:55	10. Pre-Shiller, one might have thought that Fama's results meant aggregate stock price changes predicted dividend changes. Mostly not so.
ModeledBehavior	688206801431445504	2016-01-16T03:51:02	9. Shiller's variance bounds tests led to a vast empirical literature showing return fluctuations are mostly changes in discount factors.
ModeledBehavior	688204882386354177	2016-01-16T03:43:24	8. In his Nobel lecture, IIRC, Fama says his Foundations of Finance get cited more than sold. It's great, multiple forms of empirics.
ModeledBehavior	688203808845869056	2016-01-16T03:39:08	7. Finance is another area where econometrics pays off: The wide belief in micro-efficiency is thanks to Fama's ecumenical persuasion.
ModeledBehavior	688202240742436864	2016-01-16T03:32:55	6. We debate conditions for convergence. But conditional convergence means diminishing returns to capital at the national level: Solow wins.
ModeledBehavior	688201697882066945	2016-01-16T03:30:45	5. In growth empirics, we almost all now believe in conditional convergence, thanks to the tedious work of Mankiw/Romer/Weil, Barro/S-i-M.
ModeledBehavior	688201465840599040	2016-01-16T03:29:50	4. The Unit Root debate, nerdfest par excellence, complemented this: Consistent with supply shocks + some Friedmanite money/velocity shocks.
ModeledBehavior	688200702825336833	2016-01-16T03:26:48	3. At the same time, the Sims-inspired monetary VAR work showed that money shocks, broadly construed, are maybe 25% of GDP volatility.
ModeledBehavior	688200339871236096	2016-01-16T03:25:21	2. Friedman and Schwartz, almost obviously, but also the Romer and Romer work showed that money matters.

ModeledBehavior	686979649084076032	2016-01-12T18:34:46	lymanstoneky I have to go do real work now. But consider my more formal model of optimal immigration: 
ModeledBehavior	686979489440514048	2016-01-12T18:34:08	lymanstoneky if there's one thing we don't lack for is xenophobia!
ModeledBehavior	686979431647154177	2016-01-12T18:33:54	lymanstoneky you assume big cities have infinite demand for immigration. I am doubtful, rents will rise, crowding will happen.
ModeledBehavior	686979182157369344	2016-01-12T18:32:55	lymanstoneky even if this program only lasted 15 years, it could allow struggling cities to seed a base of immigrant groups that will draw
ModeledBehavior	686979025860837376	2016-01-12T18:32:17	lymanstoneky I am doubtful such caps will be needed, but this would still represent a big increase in federalism.
ModeledBehavior	686978269346840576	2016-01-12T18:29:17	lymanstoneky very easy to set basic federal limits. "No more than 5% of MSA population per year". That simple.
ModeledBehavior	686977758644195328	2016-01-12T18:27:15	lymanstoneky also worth noting that any state that lets in far more immigrants than it can employ will probably see a big policy reversal
ModeledBehavior	686977572714852352	2016-01-12T18:26:31	lymanstoneky not constitutationally corrosive. Doesn't restrict movement, just work. Only legal analysis I know of: 
ModeledBehavior	686977216517808128	2016-01-12T18:25:06	lymanstoneky my guess is, the net federal cost of the decline of detroit has been massive. Nothing ain't cheap.
ModeledBehavior	686977045948043264	2016-01-12T18:24:25	lymanstoneky I would say lowering barriers to free movement of people is most conservative. "Do nothing" in practice will mean bailouts.
ModeledBehavior	686976900250480640	2016-01-12T18:23:51	lymanstoneky also, I think you have to judge my plan relative to any other proposal to deal with failing cities (including do nothing).
ModeledBehavior	686976762694078464	2016-01-12T18:23:18	lymanstoneky it's true federalism sometimes leads local areas to do things you don't want, that's the nature of federalism.
ModeledBehavior	686976007744557056	2016-01-12T18:20:18	lymanstoneky all your saying here is this program has the same flaws inherent to any visa program which is that workers might not comply
ModeledBehavior	686975852672757761	2016-01-12T18:19:41	lymanstoneky it's pretty easy to get here already and work in informal employment.
ModeledBehavior	686975385892814848	2016-01-12T18:17:50	lymanstoneky yes.
ModeledBehavior	686974793149591552	2016-01-12T18:15:28	lymanstoneky they can still travel around the US as they please. They just can't work wherever they'd please.
ModeledBehavior	686974723951968256	2016-01-12T18:15:12	lymanstoneky city based visas would tie them to a geography instead. Actually a smaller restriction for many I would guess.
ModeledBehavior	686974596482863104	2016-01-12T18:14:41	lymanstoneky it only requires restrictions on where they can legally work. Currently, h1b visas tie workers to a particular employer...
ModeledBehavior	686974498080346112	2016-01-12T18:14:18	lymanstoneky btw, meant to reply to your reply on shrinking cities. City based visas don't require mobility controls for immigrants...

ModeledBehavior	685125466685046784	2016-01-07T15:46:54	MattBruenig ticketdust so then high infant mortality among low SES isn't actually a problem we should address?

ModeledBehavior	685124030853169152	2016-01-07T15:41:12	MattBruenig ticketdust for example: yes, cutting mortgage int deduction to pay for well designed anti poverty policies passes CB

ModeledBehavior	685123494825357315	2016-01-07T15:39:04	MattBruenig ticketdust faced w/ that binary choice yes. But at current margins I'd say cuts elsewhere (or new taxes) have lower costs
ModeledBehavior	685122967181881344	2016-01-07T15:36:59	MattBruenig ticketdust i agree psych costs of unemployment secondary to economic. Disagree wrt consumption vs other poverty effects.
ModeledBehavior	685122469074714624	2016-01-07T15:35:00	MattBruenig ticketdust at current margins, lower than gains of spending to reduce infant mortality
ModeledBehavior	685121937715163137	2016-01-07T15:32:53	MattBruenig ticketdust I think the problems associated with poverty are bigger costs than gains from consumption redistribution
ModeledBehavior	685121185126977537	2016-01-07T15:29:54	MattBruenig ticketdust u may think it passes CB regardless but misleading to lump in all other benefits without proof they'll occur right?
ModeledBehavior	685119718047506432	2016-01-07T15:24:04	MattBruenig ticketdust I don't think u agree with them, but your argument supports them by ignoring much of what poverty is
ModeledBehavior	685119575143378944	2016-01-07T15:23:30	MattBruenig ticketdust especially since others are arguing that yes more income will fix those outcomes
ModeledBehavior	685119486836523008	2016-01-07T15:23:09	MattBruenig ticketdust and since that is how people see it, misleading to refer to one approach that wouldn't fix those outcomes as fixing
ModeledBehavior	685119350831976448	2016-01-07T15:22:36	MattBruenig ticketdust but platonic cost benefit aside, you cannot ignore that when ppl talk about poverty we refer to lots of outcomes
ModeledBehavior	685119050914115584	2016-01-07T15:21:25	MattBruenig ticketdust I agree that, eg,  high income tax rates face same opportunity costs. And anti poverty cash does too.

ModeledBehavior	685116565306654720	2016-01-07T15:11:32	MattBruenig ticketdust when discussing tax cuts as a means to reduce poverty I agree this trade off is also relevant
ModeledBehavior	685115887293231104	2016-01-07T15:08:51	MattBruenig ticketdust in the real world "mere income distribution" requires taxing, and tax $ has opportunity costs
ModeledBehavior	685115674344210433	2016-01-07T15:08:00	ticketdust MattBruenig those arguing for more consumption (cash) aren't assuming other outcomes will be fixed, or matter less.
ModeledBehavior	685115465853714432	2016-01-07T15:07:10	ticketdust MattBruenig my big point: when people discuss why they think poverty is bad, they cite outcomes other than just consumption
ModeledBehavior	685114655883276288	2016-01-07T15:03:57	ticketdust MattBruenig pre-k, and k-12 reforms as well. Think we can get more reform buy in if we're willing to spend $ instead of cut.
