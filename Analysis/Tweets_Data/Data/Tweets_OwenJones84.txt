OwenJones84	708584764467503104	2016-03-12T09:25:47	As for violence, it is being perpetrated by Trump supporters and incited by Donald Trump himself: 
OwenJones84	708584513526439937	2016-03-12T09:24:47	People seriously claiming a protest (which is free speech) shut down Donald Trump's free speech. He has the world's biggest megaphone.
OwenJones84	708578597884313600	2016-03-12T09:01:17	hugorifkind yeah, imagine if a likely presidential contender spewed racism and violence and was met with silence. it'd be beyond depressing

OwenJones84	706862451690754052	2016-03-07T15:21:56	Awifefirst Paul1Singh if you want me to say, well Empire is debated enough, or, Empire was pretty good, then I'm afraid it's not my view.

OwenJones84	706856904908218369	2016-03-07T14:59:53	Paul1Singh my article isn't about the statues. it's calling for us to have a debate about our history.

OwenJones84	706855865693900800	2016-03-07T14:55:45	Awifefirst Paul1Singh what does that even mean? it's an *opinion* piece. I *think* the bad stuff is ignored and called for a debate on it.

OwenJones84	704670567211859968	2016-03-01T14:12:10	BeccaEHarrison FernRiddell indeed.
OwenJones84	704670422143524864	2016-03-01T14:11:35	SLevelt FernRiddell read Fern's initial tweets. I find this almost comically disingenuous...
OwenJones84	704669511354597376	2016-03-01T14:07:58	AWeltch Lokster71 FernRiddell what this?  hmm I'm not sure it's me being sensitive here
OwenJones84	704668254288142336	2016-03-01T14:02:58	FernRiddell ah c'mon. Look at your first tweet. It wasn't "hey, here's some other examples to include!" But anyway. Appreciate suggestions.
OwenJones84	704667534814027777	2016-03-01T14:00:07	medievaldebbie FernRiddell Sure. But this is not an academic piece, or even a column. Just a quick few scribbles
OwenJones84	704666671185838080	2016-03-01T13:56:41	FernRiddell and actually the examples I gave were of courageous inspiring people I'm glad I included in what is a First Thoughts blog.
OwenJones84	704666275197411328	2016-03-01T13:55:06	FernRiddell so I should have used more obscure examples? I intentionally look for hooks to make things more accessible
OwenJones84	704665473003229184	2016-03-01T13:51:55	FernRiddell I don't get your point. What is your objection? These are bad examples? Not detailed enough? Not enough of them? What?
OwenJones84	704665258556825600	2016-03-01T13:51:04	Roisin_OConnor thank you x
OwenJones84	704665162406608896	2016-03-01T13:50:41	FernRiddell what's wrong with the examples I gave, like Gary Younge's piece?
OwenJones84	704664998908395520	2016-03-01T13:50:02	SLevelt FernRiddell it's a blog. A quick blog I wrote as a gay man with a few quick examples at the end. Struth.
OwenJones84	704664751318700032	2016-03-01T13:49:03	FernRiddell fine - I really was just giving a few egs I know off the top of my head to end the piece on - like Gary Y's excellent article.
OwenJones84	704663631330459648	2016-03-01T13:44:36	Blogged: how public school dominance distorts politics  wherein I agree with OwenJones84
OwenJones84	704663902999683074	2016-03-01T13:45:41	FernRiddell it just comes across as a bit "get off my land". I'm passionate about history - I did two degrees in it
OwenJones84	704663716843941888	2016-03-01T13:44:56	FernRiddell I'm not. I'm pointing out that this is a 'first thoughts' reaction blog, not an academic thesis
OwenJones84	704662947268849664	2016-03-01T13:41:53	FernRiddell but - really - do you think this attitude makes history more accessible?
OwenJones84	704662851332472833	2016-03-01T13:41:30	FernRiddell and yes, like any LGBT person, I should endeavour to remember more histories too.
OwenJones84	704662286049353728	2016-03-01T13:39:15	FernRiddell it's a quick reaction blog, not an academic thesis. They were examples off the top of my head. Of course there are many more.

OwenJones84	704257689803735040	2016-02-29T10:51:32	twlldun I genuinely appreciate this and look forward to reading it.
OwenJones84	704100910977433600	2016-02-29T00:28:33	This tweet makes me want to rock in the foetal position until the end of time 
OwenJones84	704084736994648064	2016-02-28T23:24:17	twlldun OwenJones84 factually wrong. Sanders winning among low-income whites and drawing w/ Latinos. Losing AAs and mid/upper inc voters.
OwenJones84	704084592261779456	2016-02-28T23:23:42	RobertJSomynne Zac_Lewis twlldun AbiWilks yes, fair point.

OwenJones84	704078368166289408	2016-02-28T22:58:58	stephenkb twlldun AbiWilks interesting point.
OwenJones84	704077117844283392	2016-02-28T22:54:00	stephenkb twlldun AbiWilks I gave several links, all of which disprove "he only appealed to two demographics"- w m-c activists+students
OwenJones84	704076121814540292	2016-02-28T22:50:03	stephenkb twlldun AbiWilks He claimed:  He is 100% wrong. That really is it.
OwenJones84	704075568816496642	2016-02-28T22:47:51	AbiWilks AntBreach twlldun (which is all we are saying here)
OwenJones84	704075372409839616	2016-02-28T22:47:04	on_off_course stefdelev AbiWilks twlldun well, sure, we can debate the reasons, but he has failed to counteract them, that's for rsure.
OwenJones84	704074251435962368	2016-02-28T22:42:37	twlldun AbiWilks this isn't helpful for your claims, is it? 
OwenJones84	704073816113344513	2016-02-28T22:40:53	twlldun AbiWilks oh good grief. Clinton has done better among more affluent white voters. You know this. Your claim is just wrong.
OwenJones84	704073355742322689	2016-02-28T22:39:03	stefdelev AbiWilks twlldun he has clearly not done as well among African American voters as Clinton.
OwenJones84	704073121582731265	2016-02-28T22:38:07	twlldun AbiWilks no. We are talking about *now*, and what the evidence says about where he's drawn his support from
OwenJones84	704072924647583744	2016-02-28T22:37:20	twlldun AbiWilks you're still saying this even despite the evidence. I presume you can read. So this is baffling.
OwenJones84	704072222659497984	2016-02-28T22:34:33	AbiWilks twlldun indeed. Lots! And with Sanders the demonstrable failure to inspire African American voters
OwenJones84	704070843085754368	2016-02-28T22:29:04	AbiWilks twlldun this is hilarious. He's erasing his (false) class claims and equating students with (under 30) young people
OwenJones84	704069526552498177	2016-02-28T22:23:50	twlldun AbiWilks it's so easy to look clever by knocking others down without sticking your head above a parapet with your own beliefs
OwenJones84	704069310411612160	2016-02-28T22:22:59	twlldun AbiWilks ah come on. You seem to find democratic socialists excruciatingly tedious, naive idiots. Fine. But propose something?
OwenJones84	704068933222060032	2016-02-28T22:21:29	Zac_Lewis twlldun AbiWilks no one has denied this. Everyone has said (over and over again) he fails to inspire African Americans
OwenJones84	704068691760168960	2016-02-28T22:20:31	twlldun AbiWilks you said this:  and you relied on a cliche (bourgeois lefties!!!!), not what the surveys show
OwenJones84	704068184953978880	2016-02-28T22:18:30	JosieLong AbiWilks twlldun ah, love you massive hero X
OwenJones84	704068097188220928	2016-02-28T22:18:09	twlldun AbiWilks it genuinely must be so easy to spend your life (anonymously) saying "look at how ludicrous they are!!!!"
OwenJones84	704067851452325889	2016-02-28T22:17:11	twlldun AbiWilks as we've shown here, you use a cliche (effete bourgeois leftists) which isn't backed up by the evidence
OwenJones84	704067689917112320	2016-02-28T22:16:32	twlldun AbiWilks your Twitter feed is you anonymously pouring cynicism + snark over people who (with their own identity) believe something
OwenJones84	704066225241001984	2016-02-28T22:10:43	AbiWilks twlldun Naa. Going to spend my life going "uhhh they're so thick" with a pseudonym for kicks
OwenJones84	704065547235926018	2016-02-28T22:08:02	AbiWilks twlldun ah c'mon. What a sweet gig, anonymously pouring bile and snarks over anyone who believes anything. I'd love to swap

OwenJones84	704009311740157957	2016-02-28T18:24:34	twlldun Check out this article here: 
OwenJones84	704008876828577793	2016-02-28T18:22:50	twlldun Sanders has failed to inspire African American voters and that's why he won't win. But overall has done well among poorer voters
OwenJones84	704008668090658817	2016-02-28T18:22:00	twlldun I'm not saying typical states, but Clinton obviously did far better among affluent voters in those states (and vice versa)
OwenJones84	704001130729234432	2016-02-28T17:52:03	twlldun primaries before Sat showed Sanders doing well among poorer voters, Clinton more affluent, though S failing with African Americans.
OwenJones84	704000219994832896	2016-02-28T17:48:26	twlldun this is *completely* wrong  Sanders won *low income* and younger (not simply student) voters.
OwenJones84	703964066411388928	2016-02-28T15:24:47	paulwaugh wow. what a piece of work

OwenJones84	703959567512817664	2016-02-28T15:06:54	worgztheowl twlldun and, frankly, for such an unlikely candidacy as Sanders to do so well against Clinton is no small achievement.
OwenJones84	703959360762937344	2016-02-28T15:06:05	worgztheowl twlldun Sanders campaign isn't dreaming beneath duvet. It's forced issues on agenda, but failed to inspire African-Americans.
OwenJones84	703956001884610561	2016-02-28T14:52:44	twlldun fine. But it's the easiest thing in the world to be relentlessly nihilistic instead of suggesting alternatives to how things are
OwenJones84	703954795657367552	2016-02-28T14:47:56	twlldun and any future progressive Democratic candidate must, above all else, inspire African-American voters or fail.
OwenJones84	703954311429103616	2016-02-28T14:46:01	twlldun it's not a lie to say his candidacy has built a movement. Whether it fizzles out or shifts the Democrats further open to debate.
OwenJones84	703953275775799298	2016-02-28T14:41:54	rtrnicholl twlldun then she will have to abandon specific policy commitments she's made. we're not talking about vague rhetoric.
OwenJones84	703953137258860544	2016-02-28T14:41:21	rtrnicholl twlldun  and so on.
OwenJones84	703952907696263168	2016-02-28T14:40:26	rtrnicholl twlldun  
OwenJones84	703952375426498560	2016-02-28T14:38:19	twlldun fine. but several mainstream pundits - not activists like me - believe otherwise, despite your (impressively endless) cynicism.
OwenJones84	703951565082763264	2016-02-28T14:35:06	rtrnicholl twlldun No, it isn't. Sanders has proved a focal point for the trends that article examines.
OwenJones84	703951249071333377	2016-02-28T14:33:51	rtrnicholl twlldun It will be different because of the factors that drove the Sanders campaign: 
OwenJones84	703950910783942656	2016-02-28T14:32:30	twlldun and indeed: 
OwenJones84	703950770874490881	2016-02-28T14:31:57	twlldun No. She is running considerably to the left of when she last ran in primaries in 2008.
OwenJones84	703950299111755776	2016-02-28T14:30:04	twlldun er, right.
OwenJones84	703950271878197248	2016-02-28T14:29:58	tharris113 twlldun His campaign has shifted the debate. Very considerably and undeniably.
OwenJones84	703950124649676805	2016-02-28T14:29:23	tharris113 twlldun Not a dodge. Here's my view on Sanders: 
OwenJones84	703949677708910592	2016-02-28T14:27:36	twlldun has the Sanders campaign shifted Clinton's agenda. A yes or no will do.
OwenJones84	703940187441774592	2016-02-28T13:49:53	MrFoxyVickers er - no?
OwenJones84	703938005019578368	2016-02-28T13:41:13	MrFoxyVickers um, no. you can't compare internal party elections to general elections. parallel is saying JC forced eg Burnham on to agenda

OwenJones84	703892290939568128	2016-02-28T10:39:34	Bernie Sanders can't win the nomination - but his success is forcing Clinton on to his agenda. She has to talk to the people he inspired

OwenJones84	697845157710929922	2016-02-11T18:10:25	I'm with junior doctors in Manchester; some are now talking about how they could be driven from the NHS 
OwenJones84	697831541943177219	2016-02-11T17:16:19	5Litherland ah, very nostalgic. doing a talk at HOME!
OwenJones84	697831366453563392	2016-02-11T17:15:37	All my thoughts with my super talented former colleagues at The Independent. Really tragic if it closed: I owe it a lot.

OwenJones84	697827419785465856	2016-02-11T16:59:56	5Litherland did I have a stupid grin? 😆
OwenJones84	697826717591846913	2016-02-11T16:57:09	I'm walking round Manchester with a stupid grin on my face. So glad to be back. See you tonight 😀

OwenJones84	697811921454637057	2016-02-11T15:58:21	If the media can humiliate politicians over private lives, is it any wonder 'normal' people steer clear of politics? 
OwenJones84	697801109629489152	2016-02-11T15:15:23	Hi krishgm &amp; Channel4News. Today Jeremy_Hunt said he would meet with me to discuss juniorcontract. Shall we do it on your show?
OwenJones84	697800936417337346	2016-02-11T15:14:42	David Sloman, chief executive of RoyalFreeNHS tells HSJ he does not support juniorcontract imposition. That is 4 CEOs off the list of 20
OwenJones84	697803001533177856	2016-02-11T15:22:54	Junior doctors protect our health, save our lives. Jeremy Hunt's treatment of them is beneath contempt. We owe it to them to stand by them
OwenJones84	697758464504889347	2016-02-11T12:25:56	Good video by OwenJones84 invasion of private life ends up reinforcing reactionary values and vacuous politicians 
OwenJones84	697743004602408960	2016-02-11T11:24:30	OK, you apologists for Putin and Russian bombing, paid or otherwise: I hear you. No Russian atrocity counts as an atrocity.
OwenJones84	697722178586939392	2016-02-11T10:01:45	If an economic crash looms, it's the far right who could benefit - unless the left get its act together. My column:

OwenJones84	696412554021773312	2016-02-07T19:17:46	gabyhinsliff mjxoconnor STJamesl he's trying to humiliate people for having a life. Can you seriously say this is a nice person
OwenJones84	696410099351470084	2016-02-07T19:08:01	In the United States, CEOs make 300 times what their workers make. This is simply immoral and must be dealt with.

OwenJones84	696304121339650048	2016-02-07T12:06:53	_Ginnungagap KarimPalant jdav101 SJM_TH STJamesl quite. or were homophobic+slept with men. Hypocrisy is fair game. Private lives aren't
OwenJones84	696303827989954561	2016-02-07T12:05:43	KarimPalant gabyhinsliff oh yuck. Untag me from this.
OwenJones84	696303761589981184	2016-02-07T12:05:28	KarimPalant chrisrjones STJamesl whether it's Chuka, Seb C or Brooks Newmark, I'll defend people from having their private lives splashed
OwenJones84	696303156171567105	2016-02-07T12:03:03	KarimPalant chrisrjones STJamesl a) I'm open about my criticisms of the Labour leadership b) I've discredited your ad hominem. The end.
OwenJones84	696302923328921602	2016-02-07T12:02:08	KarimPalant STJamesl How's this?  Am I biased to Chuka as well? I'm just not unpleasant. The end.
OwenJones84	696302832325128192	2016-02-07T12:01:46	NikVenkatesh KarimPalant STJamesl Indeed not.  Oh, my inherent bias again!
OwenJones84	696302735654834176	2016-02-07T12:01:23	chrisrjones KarimPalant STJamesl think I've learned all I ever need to know about this guy. Politics attracts some lovely people.
OwenJones84	696302490824896512	2016-02-07T12:00:25	KarimPalant STJamesl No, Karim, a tweet that fatally undermines your entire argument. You seem like a lovely guy.
OwenJones84	696302176793133057	2016-02-07T11:59:10	KarimPalant My inherent bias is "I'm not an unpleasant person who thinks people's irrelevant private lives are fair game"
OwenJones84	696301897993560064	2016-02-07T11:58:03	KarimPalant STJamesl a) I didn't run any campaign, b) here's me defending a Tory MP 
OwenJones84	696301624021671936	2016-02-07T11:56:58	KarimPalant STJamesl was this inherent bias?  Or do I just think private lives are private?
OwenJones84	696301240389660674	2016-02-07T11:55:27	KarimPalant SJM_TH STJamesl Yes, and there is no comparison between what you choose to put in public domain and someone's private life
OwenJones84	696300958788272129	2016-02-07T11:54:19	KarimPalant STJamesl my inherent bias? what inherent bias?
OwenJones84	696300824285290496	2016-02-07T11:53:47	KarimPalant SJM_TH STJamesl and don't compare it your *public bragging about your lifestyle on a public publishing platform*
OwenJones84	696300633662611456	2016-02-07T11:53:02	KarimPalant SJM_TH STJamesl yes, they should scrutinise powerful, but what does "special advisor goes on dates" have to do with anything?
OwenJones84	696300476023889920	2016-02-07T11:52:24	KarimPalant STJamesl A special advisor having a lovelife being splashed in newspapers is "democracy". JFC.
OwenJones84	696299492396638208	2016-02-07T11:48:30	KarimPalant STJamesl I'm sorry, I genuinely can't deal with this level of idiocy.
OwenJones84	696298722523803648	2016-02-07T11:45:26	KarimPalant STJamesl and what people post on Twitter is obviously "fair game" because they're publicly publishing for the world to see
OwenJones84	696298577023365120	2016-02-07T11:44:52	KarimPalant STJamesl I'm sorry? Professionalism means "not having a love life"? Are you being serious
OwenJones84	696296528214888450	2016-02-07T11:36:43	election_data STJamesl oh. Yeah. Getcha.
OwenJones84	696295979289612288	2016-02-07T11:34:32	election_data STJamesl eh?
OwenJones84	696294936099086337	2016-02-07T11:30:23	STJamesl No, I would find it an irrelevant tawdry intrusion into his private life. I genuinely don't understand how people like you work.
OwenJones84	696270412993470464	2016-02-07T09:52:57	Feels all wrong for this to be news. He's an unmarried 20sthng on Tinder like every other 20sthng. So what?  
OwenJones84	696281046908858368	2016-02-07T10:35:12	STJamesl Pathetic.
OwenJones84	696050301141438464	2016-02-06T19:18:18	rjxjohnson Purfleetjohn feedthedrummer absolutely. The worst Labour government is better than the "best" Tory government
OwenJones84	696038962083840000	2016-02-06T18:33:14	Purfleetjohn I didn't bury them. I wrote about them, as I've just shared. I just focused all my firepower on Tories
OwenJones84	696038418581684224	2016-02-06T18:31:05	Purfleetjohn it's not trashing. It's understanding why we lost so badly. For example 
OwenJones84	696038185323859968	2016-02-06T18:30:09	Purfleetjohn I said it was incoherent at the time, as I've just shared with you, and I'm sorry you missed it.

OwenJones84	696037375307345921	2016-02-06T18:26:56	Purfleetjohn no, I argued for people to kick out the Tories. My view was consistent. Read, say, the 10th paragraph

OwenJones84	696034651094282241	2016-02-06T18:16:07	Purfleetjohn feedthedrummer I wanted Labour to win (desperately) but they failed to offer a credible correct alternative. This isn't hard

OwenJones84	696031950453239808	2016-02-06T18:05:23	feedthedrummer I'm really not convinced the Corbyn leadership bid did any trashing of Ed Miliband's leadership personally.
OwenJones84	696031594683961344	2016-02-06T18:03:58	Purfleetjohn feedthedrummer eh? I would always call for people to vote Labour even if the offer was flawed. Bizarre!
OwenJones84	696022515748118528	2016-02-06T17:27:53	feedthedrummer well, I don't think Labour offered anything coherent at last election, and I'm on the "Labour Left" and have never done that
OwenJones84	696003415688798208	2016-02-06T16:12:00	feedthedrummer I mean you can't frame "having a clear workable economic plan" as being negative but I don't understand why
OwenJones84	696003173924868097	2016-02-06T16:11:02	feedthedrummer the implications are a coherent alternative to Osbornomics, cleaning up politics and a new foreign policy, I guess?
OwenJones84	696000471899729920	2016-02-06T16:00:18	feedthedrummer but (with respect) I think you're missing my point. I'm just explaining what lay behind so many people voting for JC.
OwenJones84	695999359469666305	2016-02-06T15:55:52	feedthedrummer No, I'm saying these are the reasons people ended up voting for Corbyn rather than the other candidates.

OwenJones84	695177982449696768	2016-02-04T09:32:01	helenlewis my point was it is politically lethal to argue for generation against generation - the left has to unite the generations
OwenJones84	695177108922966016	2016-02-04T09:28:33	helenlewis and the third paragraph of the piece - you can't homogenise generations
OwenJones84	695176769192747008	2016-02-04T09:27:12	IainSimpson twlldun again, I refer to my previous tweet.
OwenJones84	695176613374345216	2016-02-04T09:26:35	helenlewis totally against the idea of generational conflict (see the last paragraph of the piece today)

OwenJones84	693803615362883585	2016-01-31T14:30:46	Russia has reportedly killed about 1,400 civilians in Syria so far: 
OwenJones84	693885458699456515	2016-01-31T19:55:59	JoanRaymond13 why apart from Bernie? Why is he excluded here?
OwenJones84	693882414322601984	2016-01-31T19:43:53	EllieCumbo nope. I'm opposing your view we can't criticise the death penalty because only abolished (like banning of homosexuality) in 60s
OwenJones84	693881965263634432	2016-01-31T19:42:06	EllieCumbo again you're trying to deflect from your view that we can't criticise what we abolished half a century ago
OwenJones84	693881385845678080	2016-01-31T19:39:48	EllieCumbo I didn't back Obama, though in 08 and 12 there was no anti-death penalty candidate with a chance of winning the nomination
OwenJones84	693880828376584192	2016-01-31T19:37:35	bevcraig haha
OwenJones84	693880715658813440	2016-01-31T19:37:08	EllieCumbo it's not an insult. I am baffled. You're saying we only abolished death penalty in 60s, so give Clinton slack.
OwenJones84	693879902706274305	2016-01-31T19:33:55	EllieCumbo Here's me being slammed by Fox News for opposing Obama  Please answer the question.
OwenJones84	693879291633868801	2016-01-31T19:31:29	EllieCumbo Your absurd logic was we're in no position to criticise the death penalty because only abolished in the 60s - like homosexuality
OwenJones84	693878024811499520	2016-01-31T19:26:27	BriW74 EllieCumbo politicians long before Blair - both Tory and Labour - opposed and abolished the death penalty
OwenJones84	693877718937649153	2016-01-31T19:25:14	zagbah EllieCumbo do you really, seriously think that's my view?
OwenJones84	693877360056229888	2016-01-31T19:23:48	EllieCumbo nope, you can't try and shift the goalposts. By your logic we're in no position to oppose foreign homophobia, correct?
OwenJones84	693876747213881348	2016-01-31T19:21:22	EllieCumbo Bernie Sanders has a D minus grade from the NRA. And he doesn't back the state murdering people, including 15 women since 1976
OwenJones84	693875383683420160	2016-01-31T19:15:57	EllieCumbo (and I'm fully aware of when the death penalty was abolished but that really wasn't the point)
OwenJones84	693875085963350016	2016-01-31T19:14:46	EllieCumbo er let's use your (embarrassing) logic. Homosexuality was only decriminalised in 1967 here so why oppose foreign homophobes
OwenJones84	693873960497332229	2016-01-31T19:10:18	EllieCumbo it's 2016, not 1946, last time I checked
OwenJones84	693873195879960576	2016-01-31T19:07:16	WingsScotland then I really am at a loss at your point, but anyway your claim was wrong.
OwenJones84	693872979315396608	2016-01-31T19:06:24	EllieCumbo "not a perfect fit" meaning electrocuting mentally ill African Americans, you mean
OwenJones84	693871841165742080	2016-01-31T19:01:53	WingsScotland nope. Your point was wrong in both senses. Majority don't back it, politicians can oppose it and win.
OwenJones84	693870940757827584	2016-01-31T18:58:18	WingsScotland polls show more Americans and Britons back the death penalty than don't, and yet politicians here managed to take a stand
OwenJones84	693870698620538880	2016-01-31T18:57:20	WingsScotland you mean like AV, which the polls showed most Britons backed when the referendum was announced. Right.
OwenJones84	693870223565406209	2016-01-31T18:55:27	WingsScotland yes they do. If they though the state killing people was such a priority, a party backing the death penalty would win.
OwenJones84	693870053431844865	2016-01-31T18:54:46	WingsScotland you said the majority of Britons backed the death penalty, I was just pointing out that's not true!
OwenJones84	693869745699971072	2016-01-31T18:53:33	WingsScotland the British people vote almost unanimously for parties that oppose the death penalty.
OwenJones84	693869543236726784	2016-01-31T18:52:45	WingsScotland Naa. Not picky. Just the truth.
OwenJones84	693869396868075525	2016-01-31T18:52:10	WingsScotland I'll stick by the British social attitudes survey if that's ok. Do you support the state killing people?
OwenJones84	693868842808950784	2016-01-31T18:49:58	WingsScotland a) not true  b) you make my point - you can oppose the death penalty and win elections
OwenJones84	693867395904114689	2016-01-31T18:44:13	British Labour backers of Hillary Clinton baffle me. For example, she backs the death penalty, a position that would disgust them at home

OwenJones84	692295431703912450	2016-01-27T10:37:47	oliveronte So let me get this right. You'll support the West's bombs in Syria as long as they say they back Assad.
OwenJones84	692295328062672897	2016-01-27T10:37:23	medialens Why don't you post the entire article to your followers instead of taking a paragraph out of context for your dishonest ends.
OwenJones84	692295023631679488	2016-01-27T10:36:10	BobSmithWalker medialens From the piece they're quoting. Their dishonesty is beyond satire. 
OwenJones84	692294681149992960	2016-01-27T10:34:48	corin_ja medialens They do this all the time. Which is ironic, given they claim to criticise the dishonesty and distortions of the MSM.

OwenJones84	692293903333089280	2016-01-27T10:31:43	corin_ja medialens Corin, read it in context. It is farcical dishonesty on their part. The quoted paragraph is summing up views of others.
OwenJones84	692293756087881728	2016-01-27T10:31:08	oliveronte So, what, you support Putin's bombing of Syria? Is your criticism of the West they're not bombing it enough?

OwenJones84	692293129265889282	2016-01-27T10:28:38	BobSmithWalker medialens Bob, this is almost a comical distortion on their point. That paragraph is summing up the views of *others*

OwenJones84	689487473337065472	2016-01-19T16:39:58	andybell5news reporterboy stephenkb because their "overspending" caused the crisis. "why hand the keys back to the driver who crashed..."

OwenJones84	689486257597083649	2016-01-19T16:35:08	reporterboy my thoughts are here: 
OwenJones84	689484174105956352	2016-01-19T16:26:51	No question though: Labour had no coherent or consistent alternative, and an unconvincing message on immigration/social security.
OwenJones84	689482344059789313	2016-01-19T16:19:35	sheffieldlamby stephenkb No, that's not what the report is saying.

OwenJones84	689482087443873792	2016-01-19T16:18:34	stephenkb I think it's made all the time! Labour lurched to the left, yes under a useless left-wing leader, and therefore lost
OwenJones84	689481475914358790	2016-01-19T16:16:08	stephenkb Well, my point was the common "Labour lost for being too left-wing and that's really all there is to it" argument is debunked.
OwenJones84	689481148901257216	2016-01-19T16:14:50	stephenkb yes, as I covered yesterday:  but conclusion "Labour lost because too left-wing, the end" gets a kicking
OwenJones84	689480409130909696	2016-01-19T16:11:54	stephenkb ...but the idea "Labour lost because it was too 'left-wing', the end" is obviously trashed.
OwenJones84	689480314289262592	2016-01-19T16:11:31	stephenkb yes, "we did fail to convert voters in demographic groups who are traditionally seen as in the centre"...
OwenJones84	689480182189707264	2016-01-19T16:11:00	stephenkb "some of those who supported us would have been less likely to had they seen us as less left wing"
OwenJones84	689480132524937216	2016-01-19T16:10:48	stephenkb "Many of our most “left wing” polices were the most popular."
OwenJones84	689480042397745156	2016-01-19T16:10:26	stephenkb "the majority of people thought that the cuts were going too far and preferred higher taxes to further cuts"
OwenJones84	689479969433600000	2016-01-19T16:10:09	stephenkb "polls showed a wish, from voters, for us to be tougher on big business"
OwenJones84	689479847828144128	2016-01-19T16:09:40	(Yes, it says "not a simple discussion", but the specifics - on deficit reduction / "anti-business" / "anti-aspiration" - are compelling)
OwenJones84	689479487294173184	2016-01-19T16:08:14	stephenkb well, I've posted it all so people can read it - think deficit reduction / anti-business / anti-aspiration answers are key.
