jeffspross	725359903561273346	2016-04-27T16:24:12	portereduardo I think it's a good piece! I'm just more skeptical that export-lead development is only possible route for poor countries.

jeffspross	725358421122260992	2016-04-27T16:18:18	robertwaldmann I'm not defending Friedman's specific numbers. But R&amp;R's critique of Freidman's numbers rest on certain theoretical...
jeffspross	725356789466714114	2016-04-27T16:11:49	robertwaldmann His projection would certainly not involve a 5.3% growth average for the *second* 10 years.
jeffspross	725356625364668418	2016-04-27T16:11:10	robertwaldmann ...followed by a long decline and stabilization at lower growth. Which is perfectly reasonable.
jeffspross	725356503759097856	2016-04-27T16:10:41	robertwaldmann Pointing to the average is brazenly dishonest. Friedman predicted a short burst of very high growth...
jeffspross	725356221444841472	2016-04-27T16:09:34	robertwaldmann 2) I think the Wolfers/Romer/CEA view that stimulus spending impact simply goes away when stimulus ends is wrong.
jeffspross	725356025411334144	2016-04-27T16:08:47	robertwaldmann 1) I don't think "the multiplier is 10" is a fair description of Friedman's claim.
jeffspross	725355594572394497	2016-04-27T16:07:04	robertwaldmann 
jeffspross	725354581736083457	2016-04-27T16:03:03	robertwaldmann And Freidman has since made it clear he didn't realize how far the mainstream had actually strayed from Keynesianism.
jeffspross	725354000908849153	2016-04-27T16:00:44	robertwaldmann And some parts of that paper are wrong in flat out lazy ways. Friedman does NOT predict 5.3% growth for 10 yrs straight.
jeffspross	725353669353316353	2016-04-27T15:59:25	robertwaldmann Well no shit! But they never actually defend mainstream assumptions. R&amp;R just take mainstream as gospel and move on.
jeffspross	725353481427546113	2016-04-27T15:58:41	robertwaldmann They keep saying mainstream does not agree w/ Freidman's assumptions about out-year effects of demand stimulus.
jeffspross	725352333895471106	2016-04-27T15:54:07	robertwaldmann I have read it and I did not find it convincing. Not Friedman's analysis was airtight, but that wasn't a good rebuttal.

jeffspross	724982801833951235	2016-04-26T15:25:44	8. And because Euro countries do so much more redistribution and public service provision, net effect for the poor is highly progressive.
jeffspross	724982613069336576	2016-04-26T15:24:59	7. They just bring so much more revenue overall that they need a VAT too, and that results in a more regressive tax system on net.
jeffspross	724982423461580800	2016-04-26T15:24:13	6. Euro marginal income tax rates on the wealthy are actually considerably higher than in the US.
jeffspross	724982326258634752	2016-04-26T15:23:50	5. Furthermore, the higher regressivity of European tax system has to understood in the context that they take in way more $$$ than the US.
jeffspross	724982108297416706	2016-04-26T15:22:58	4. We don't live in that country. We live in America, where the extra burden any tax policy places on the poor needs to be taken seriously.
jeffspross	724981931280986112	2016-04-26T15:22:16	3. Whatever burden the taxes imposed on the poor would be more than offset by countervailing policy.
jeffspross	724981833973157888	2016-04-26T15:21:53	2. In a country w/ policy devotion to low poverty, low inequality &amp; high employment, complaints re: soda taxes' regressivity would be dumb.
jeffspross	724981555811098624	2016-04-26T15:20:47	1. A bit more anti-paulkrugman ranting: he's piece on soda taxes is dumb. 
jeffspross	724980432312262656	2016-04-26T15:16:19	Remarkable how much energy the anti-Friedman crowd has put into posturing, vs how little they've put into *actually analyzing his model.*

jeffspross	723526887348310017	2016-04-22T15:00:27	The 2nd question is moral: How bad do you think the human suffering under the status quo is? And how much risk is worth changing it?
jeffspross	723526678564208640	2016-04-22T14:59:37	The first is technical: What sort of risks does that gamble entail, and how big/likely do we think they are?
jeffspross	723526537509756932	2016-04-22T14:59:03	There are basically two questions to ask when deciding if we should roll the dice on big deficit spending.

jeffspross	723522307772297217	2016-04-22T14:42:15	hamandcheese The job of fed chair is to maintain full employment while keeping inflation at reasonable levels.

jeffspross	723521114236923904	2016-04-22T14:37:30	ObsoleteDogma DouthatNYT yeselson Right. The "speed up" wasn't much more than the kind of natural blip you get in all dynamic systems.
jeffspross	723520494717272064	2016-04-22T14:35:02	hamandcheese The only way we get an inflation problem is if we solve the economic growth problem. In which case tax hikes are no big deal.
jeffspross	723520286960832512	2016-04-22T14:34:13	hamandcheese The Fed can bring down interest rates. Only limit on how far they go w/ that is inflation.
jeffspross	723520028079972352	2016-04-22T14:33:11	DouthatNYT yeselson What we undertook right after the Great Recession was extremely watered down Keynesianism.
jeffspross	723519543180664835	2016-04-22T14:31:16	DouthatNYT yeselson That we've relied on private borrowing rather than gov't borrowing to fule growth is the problem w/ post-80 economy.
jeffspross	723519288687112192	2016-04-22T14:30:15	DouthatNYT yeselson The late-90s full employment was driven by a massive private leverage bubble. That turned out well.
jeffspross	723517708575379457	2016-04-22T14:23:58	yeselson DouthatNYT Right. I think an economy w/ robust wage growth and less inequality would get you that buy in.
jeffspross	723517429930987522	2016-04-22T14:22:52	DouthatNYT The status quo is inexcusable as a basic matter of human decency.
jeffspross	723517333306793984	2016-04-22T14:22:29	DouthatNYT I could be wrong. But I don't see how you defend the status quo as preferable to that risk-taking on moral grounds.
jeffspross	723517167455604737	2016-04-22T14:21:49	DouthatNYT And if we fix that problem, the political economy around tax hikes will be completely different.
jeffspross	723517047263662081	2016-04-22T14:21:21	DouthatNYT My point is, the only way that happens is if we solve the problem higher deficits are aimed at solving - fixing the economy.
jeffspross	723516891810172929	2016-04-22T14:20:43	DouthatNYT Yes. Eventually you'll drive up inflation, which will force a rise in interest rates and thus tax hikes.
jeffspross	723516676701065216	2016-04-22T14:19:52	DouthatNYT Well yeah, because the economy has been chronically terrible since 1980.
jeffspross	723516427081265152	2016-04-22T14:18:53	DouthatNYT Only if you don't understand how debt issued by a central gov't with a fiat currency system actually operates.
jeffspross	723516228938153984	2016-04-22T14:18:05	DouthatNYT There's a reason mid-century full employment and inequality coincided w/ balanced budgets and higher tax rates.
jeffspross	723516101561356288	2016-04-22T14:17:35	DouthatNYT In which case, broad tax hikes to close the deficit will become a lot more politically plausible.
jeffspross	723515973685391360	2016-04-22T14:17:05	DouthatNYT Moreover, if inflation becomes a threat again, it's because the economy has taken off and wages are growing robustly.
jeffspross	723515796207599616	2016-04-22T14:16:22	DouthatNYT Well some of Sanders agenda is permanent (SP) and some of it isn't ($1T on infrastructure).
jeffspross	723515084446810113	2016-04-22T14:13:33	hamandcheese No.
jeffspross	723514649757515776	2016-04-22T14:11:49	And guess what? When that happens, the Fed can just lower interest rates again by buying up US debt itself. It has no trouble doing THAT.
jeffspross	723514369439633408	2016-04-22T14:10:42	Once economic activity picks up and other investment opportunities arise, investors will leave US debt and interest rates will rise.
jeffspross	723514241878249472	2016-04-22T14:10:12	Ergo, the way to fix the economy is to have the federal gov't borrow a shit ton and invest in the economy.
jeffspross	723514031219286016	2016-04-22T14:09:21	The remarkable thing about monetary policy right now is the Fed is trying to RAISE interest rates and can't seem to make it happen.
jeffspross	723513566045835265	2016-04-22T14:07:31	If the private markets could fix this, they'd have done so already, investors would invest elsewhere, and interest on US debt would rise.
jeffspross	723513334704779264	2016-04-22T14:06:35	Investors are pouring into that safe asset because there's nothing else they want to invest in. That's because the economy sucks.
jeffspross	723513162931290113	2016-04-22T14:05:54	To repeat the same argument for the upteenth time: Interest rates on US debt are super-low because it's a safe asset.
jeffspross	723512857405599744	2016-04-22T14:04:42	I'd love to hear DouthatNYT's reasons for thinking this view is wrong.

jeffspross	722180190185656321	2016-04-18T21:49:09	The right policy tools under this idea aren't taxes. They're unions, antitrust laws, &amp; full employment via aggregate demand management.
jeffspross	722179857799651329	2016-04-18T21:47:50	That would, of course, leave little or no profits to tax.

jeffspross	722060796046524416	2016-04-18T13:54:43	MeadBadger kev_jg Which is functionally indistinguishable from having the gov't just cut you a check.

jeffspross	720674286965506050	2016-04-14T18:05:14	It’s basically saying: If interest payments were a lot higher, interest payments would actually be a problem. No kidding!
jeffspross	720674102000926720	2016-04-14T18:04:30	Interest rates probably aren’t going to get that high, at least not for a long time. Look at Japan. It’s had near-zero rates for 20 years.

jeffspross	720643873848987648	2016-04-14T16:04:23	If the slices stay fixed as proportions (i.e. top 1% stay at 10% of nat income) then "growing the whole pie" does grow every slice equally.
jeffspross	720643415017279488	2016-04-14T16:02:33	It's a subtle distinction that gets lost in the inequality debate. (Left is guilty here too, I happily admit.) But it's super important.
jeffspross	720642666078167040	2016-04-14T15:59:35	The 50s, 60s &amp; 70s were unequal. The top 1% pulled in 10% of the national income. But they *stayed* at 10% for three straight decades.

jeffspross	717755076882903044	2016-04-06T16:45:20	I think those are 1) low levels of inequality, &amp; 2) being at or close to full employment. You need to fulfill BOTH for harm to be likely.
jeffspross	717754774930763776	2016-04-06T16:44:08	If we're concerned the minimum wage will harm labor markets, we should identify what conditions under which harm is most likely.

jeffspross	717376838117404673	2016-04-05T15:42:21	zackbeauchamp MattBruenig ...in which case saying trade increased China's growth on net would be a lot more plausible.
jeffspross	717376751282692096	2016-04-05T15:42:00	zackbeauchamp MattBruenig There's an alternative history where trade w/ China involved US trade surplus / China trade deficit...
jeffspross	717376640343343104	2016-04-05T15:41:33	zackbeauchamp MattBruenig I'd happily argue that trade w/ China as it actually occurred did little to increase its GDP/jobs supply.
jeffspross	717374463180808192	2016-04-05T15:32:54	zackbeauchamp ethangach That's Econ 101. It's definitional.
jeffspross	717374401524576256	2016-04-05T15:32:40	zackbeauchamp ethangach If Country A is in a goods/services trade surplus w/ Country B, then it's a net lender of capital to Country B.
jeffspross	717373861054971904	2016-04-05T15:30:31	zackbeauchamp ethangach No no no. The US being in trade deficit w/ China means China is sending us more capital on net.
jeffspross	717373719744647168	2016-04-05T15:29:57	zackbeauchamp ethangach ...than it takes in is indeed very weird and contradicts standard trade theory.
jeffspross	717373620570300416	2016-04-05T15:29:33	zackbeauchamp ethangach And for a poor country that's trying to develop to *on net* send more goods/services/capital to a rich country...
jeffspross	717373475359297536	2016-04-05T15:28:59	zackbeauchamp ethangach That the US lost jobs to China *on net* is due to the fact that we've been in persistent trade deficit w/ them.
jeffspross	717373377514606592	2016-04-05T15:28:36	zackbeauchamp ethangach Countries "trade jobs" all the time. Hell, different markets w/in countries do that too.
jeffspross	717373244714516484	2016-04-05T15:28:04	zackbeauchamp ethangach I think you're missing the central point about the trade flows and who's in surplus/deficit.
jeffspross	717370541766643712	2016-04-05T15:17:19	zackbeauchamp ethangach How so?

jeffspross	717348669389987840	2016-04-05T13:50:25	What terrifies me is the suspicion that lots of people pushing EITC/education/etc don't even think in terms of capacity or full employment.
jeffspross	717348161971470337	2016-04-05T13:48:24	Always remember: saying education/training is a solution to inequality assumes labor markets are already as tight as they can possibly get.

jeffspross	717073522825105408	2016-04-04T19:37:05	hamandcheese ...with subsidies, you'll probably be fine. The problem is that fans of step 3 in the US oppose steps 1 and 2.
jeffspross	717073256906248192	2016-04-04T19:36:01	hamandcheese So yes, if you democratize business control, maintain full employment policies, AND free up businesses to pay lower wages...
jeffspross	717073050731094017	2016-04-04T19:35:12	hamandcheese Oh for Christ's sake. Germany removed its budget deficit cap at the same time and has run massive trade surpluses since.
jeffspross	717071066787667968	2016-04-04T19:27:19	MeadBadger Yes and you know that their insistence on keeping inflation low means screwing everyone else.

jeffspross	717065739467763712	2016-04-04T19:06:09	MeadBadger No, I'm pointing out that "low inflation" = "low wage pressure and low job creation."
jeffspross	717065428195880960	2016-04-04T19:04:55	hamandcheese That's not wage subsidies. That's worker control. German firms are way more democratic than in the US. 
jeffspross	717064308648050688	2016-04-04T19:00:28	MeadBadger This is one reason why we should massively expand SS to crowd out the need for other forms of retirement income.

jeffspross	717056907312279553	2016-04-04T18:31:03	hamandcheese I.E. it subsidizes a very particular business model. And that's the problem. 
jeffspross	717056797027254272	2016-04-04T18:30:37	hamandcheese That's what increases labor participation because it allows employers to hire more at less cost.
jeffspross	717056681499340801	2016-04-04T18:30:09	hamandcheese I'm not. Lowering the wage from the perspective of the employer is what I'm referring to.

jeffspross	717052939328557057	2016-04-04T18:15:17	hamandcheese Rothstein's work on the EITC is centered around the idea that it boosts labor participation by lowering wages.

jeffspross	717035915055464448	2016-04-04T17:07:38	WillEvans215 ...so wealth ownership is more egalitarian by the time people hit retirement. And bulking up workers bargaining power...
jeffspross	717035788370731009	2016-04-04T17:07:08	WillEvans215 The fix here is not "keep inflation low." It's increase generosity of SS benefits, and bulk up worker bargaining power...
jeffspross	717035642866118656	2016-04-04T17:06:33	WillEvans215 But they have more than other age groups.
jeffspross	717035560146051072	2016-04-04T17:06:14	WillEvans215 3) Seniors don't have much wealth because everybody doesn't have much. Wealth ownership is insanely skewed.
jeffspross	717035422006661120	2016-04-04T17:05:41	WillEvans215 1) These measures of income don't count Medicare. 2) Social Security benefits are indexed to grow w/ inflation.

jeffspross	717026560633663491	2016-04-04T16:30:28	WillEvans215 So if you don't want policies that spread wealth and incomes more evenly and also raise inflation, what do you want?
jeffspross	717026404970397696	2016-04-04T16:29:51	WillEvans215 Well, right now we have: low inflation, young people with no incomes or wealth, and old people with incomes &amp; wealth.
jeffspross	717026088732508160	2016-04-04T16:28:35	normative And that's odd, given that avoiding gov't &amp; using social/market institutions to affect chance is big part of conservatism.
jeffspross	717024264545771522	2016-04-04T16:21:20	hamandcheese Then what do you do? And how do you pay for this EITC in a way that doesn't just take from the poor w/ the other hand?
jeffspross	717024143531708417	2016-04-04T16:20:52	hamandcheese So you subsidize those wages, which encourages even more low-wage, high-profit margin biz models.
jeffspross	717024060962635778	2016-04-04T16:20:32	hamandcheese Okay. So you don't manage agg demand. This means businesses have to pay workers less and less to employ everyone.
jeffspross	717023634267705348	2016-04-04T16:18:50	j_henry2 DouthatNYT Which is the collapse of full employment. But full employment requires the money flows to activate all those workers.
jeffspross	717023332189741056	2016-04-04T16:17:38	WillEvans215 Given that seniors are the wealthiest age cohort in the economy, I can't say that concerns me much.
jeffspross	717022870648582145	2016-04-04T16:15:48	hamandcheese Well then if you want good wages and tight labor markets you're gonna have to get your big gov't keynesianism on.
jeffspross	717022589814706180	2016-04-04T16:14:41	Someone has to do all this "support work," &amp; their labor has to be cheap enough for the creative class to afford. 
jeffspross	717021890204868608	2016-04-04T16:11:54	WillEvans215 JHWeissmann Not if the gov't keeps running the fiscal/monetary policy it's running now, they won't.
jeffspross	717021489866883073	2016-04-04T16:10:19	One thing ryanavent misses here is the creative class life model relies on a poorly paid underclass to function. 
jeffspross	717019841690005504	2016-04-04T16:03:46	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT Either we force the corps to build jobs &amp; good wages, or we find an alternative institution that can.
jeffspross	717019626866126848	2016-04-04T16:02:55	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT "One way or another we're at the mercy of our corporate overlords" isn't a sufficient answer.
jeffspross	717019527725367296	2016-04-04T16:02:31	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT Well ultimately that is the place to take it.
jeffspross	717019396535894016	2016-04-04T16:02:00	j_henry2 DouthatNYT Corps don't fight inequality. They only fight it if gov't policy forces them to. Or gov't policy fights it directly.
jeffspross	717019246954475520	2016-04-04T16:01:24	j_henry2 DouthatNYT The reason they don't have better options is because inequality is strip-mining the economy of real activity.
jeffspross	717019076455956481	2016-04-04T16:00:44	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT I don't think they'd mind of if the McDs jobs got replaced by jobs w/ higher pay and better conditions.
jeffspross	717018852996022273	2016-04-04T15:59:50	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT The gov't isn't cash-constrained. It's just inflation-constrained.
jeffspross	717018679905554432	2016-04-04T15:59:09	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT If the corps don't want to do that, we have a gov't that can print all the money it wants.
jeffspross	717018552319012864	2016-04-04T15:58:39	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT The only reason we need the corporations' money is to activate real resources here in the economy.
jeffspross	717018462036606980	2016-04-04T15:58:17	JHWeissmann yeselson DouthatNYT Honestly, my attitude is just: then let the capital go elsewhere.
jeffspross	717017997974614016	2016-04-04T15:56:26	yeselson DouthatNYT ...and then returning to 1960s era income tax rates.
jeffspross	717017937908002816	2016-04-04T15:56:12	yeselson DouthatNYT Depends on context. I'd be fine eliminating corp tax, treating all cap gains/divs/etc as normal income...
jeffspross	717016794687528960	2016-04-04T15:51:40	yeselson DouthatNYT So I agree there's more than one solution. But neither is happening now, &amp; even reformocons have no coherent response.
jeffspross	717016497382682624	2016-04-04T15:50:29	yeselson DouthatNYT Sufficient bargaining power would result either in low profit margins or equitable distribution of wealth ownership.
jeffspross	717015059990503424	2016-04-04T15:44:46	j_henry2 DouthatNYT No it isn't.  
jeffspross	717014779420872704	2016-04-04T15:43:39	DouthatNYT It also points to the *conservative* arg for the min wage: It cuts out gov't middle man, redistributes downward via biz models.
jeffspross	717014628388184069	2016-04-04T15:43:03	DouthatNYT Which is why EITC needs to be paired with highly progressive, distributive tax rates on the high end.
jeffspross	717014484833972224	2016-04-04T15:42:29	DouthatNYT ...income ladder, that will boost aggregate demand, tighten labor market, and achieve maximal competitive equilibrium.
jeffspross	717014338335322113	2016-04-04T15:41:54	DouthatNYT That depends entirely on what the gov't is doing on the spending side of the ledger. If it's pumping a lot of money down the...
jeffspross	717013850655232000	2016-04-04T15:39:58	JHWeissmann Outside the wonks, none do. This is part of my ongoing implicit campaign to convince DouthatNYT he's in the wrong party.
jeffspross	717013663375302656	2016-04-04T15:39:13	DouthatNYT Ergo it cannot be a criticism of tax rates that they minimized profit margins.
jeffspross	717013521649807361	2016-04-04T15:38:39	DouthatNYT The point here is that the competitive pressure and the tax rates both achieve the same thing: minimized profit margins.
jeffspross	717013032711360512	2016-04-04T15:36:43	DouthatNYT Maximal competitive pressure is the right is constantly saying we need more of to get back to growth.
jeffspross	717012926046015488	2016-04-04T15:36:17	DouthatNYT If you don't have any profits/cap gains/dividends to tax, a tax on those things won't apply to you that year.
jeffspross	717012755165945856	2016-04-04T15:35:36	DouthatNYT You realize minimal profit margins are what occur in conditions of maximal competitive pressure, right?
jeffspross	717012391779807233	2016-04-04T15:34:10	DouthatNYT ...forces businesses to pay more of their revenue flow to workers, and less to management/shareholders.
jeffspross	717012276302229504	2016-04-04T15:33:42	DouthatNYT But one min wage advantage is you don't *have* to spot the surplus. Instead, you're setting up an ecological pressure that...
jeffspross	717012139374952450	2016-04-04T15:33:10	DouthatNYT Long-term surpluses are easy to spot too. They're annual surpluses that keep reappearing.
jeffspross	717011850110582784	2016-04-04T15:32:01	DouthatNYT The point is reducing margin as much as possible. That's what happens in full employment, which I assume we both want.
jeffspross	717011600662732800	2016-04-04T15:31:01	DouthatNYT Dude, a corporate surplus is the easiest thing in the world to spot. It's called a profit margin.
jeffspross	717010577198026753	2016-04-04T15:26:57	DouthatNYT You can't be cutting other welfare programs as pay fors. You tax rich/corps to pay for EITC, or you deficit spend.
jeffspross	717010342228992000	2016-04-04T15:26:01	DouthatNYT EITC subsidizes low-wage, high-profit-margin biz models. So you gotta capture that extra corporate surplus somehow.

jeffspross	717008602469429248	2016-04-04T15:19:06	DouthatNYT Does it? Minimum wage simply declares a value the economy is expected to provide. That's why it's politically popular.
jeffspross	717007604006912000	2016-04-04T15:15:08	DouthatNYT Min wage just tells businesses: "You don't get to exist unless you pay your workers at least X. You figure out how to do that."
jeffspross	717007385705979904	2016-04-04T15:14:16	DouthatNYT It absolutely does not. EITC takes you down a rabbit hole of how to design the credit, phase outs, how to pay for it, etc.
jeffspross	717006718828421121	2016-04-04T15:11:37	The weirdest thing about cons preferring EITC over min wage is it's the latter that shifts income distribution *via market institutions.*

jeffspross	716011322119299072	2016-04-01T21:16:16	PeterFavaloro There's just a very big "concern troll" aspect to whole min wage debate. Plenty of wonks who oppose min wage are serious...
jeffspross	716011061711745024	2016-04-01T21:15:14	PeterFavaloro If there was a majority in the GOP saying "we'll pass a UBI if you drop the min wage hike," that would be worth discussing.
jeffspross	716002486339801088	2016-04-01T20:41:10	PeterFavaloro The idea that $15/hour is too high is gut instinct, and the 1/2 of median wage rule of thumb is basically eyeballing history.
jeffspross	716002350490640384	2016-04-01T20:40:37	PeterFavaloro And AFAIK the various econ schools give no framework for predicting where the tipping point is.
jeffspross	716002244685131777	2016-04-01T20:40:12	PeterFavaloro Obviously there's a tipping point. $200/hour would destroy jobs. But we don't know where that tipping point is.
jeffspross	716002107464278017	2016-04-01T20:39:39	PeterFavaloro So higher price of labor means higher incomes, especially for the bottom, which means higher agg demand, &amp; *more* jobs.
jeffspross	716001986429247489	2016-04-01T20:39:10	PeterFavaloro But labor is people. Who *supply* demand in the economy. Which is true of nothing else "bought &amp; sold" on the market.

jeffspross	716001704236421121	2016-04-01T20:38:03	PeterFavaloro The assumption that you lose jobs from the min wage comes from conceiving of the price signals for labor as the same as...

jeffspross	715232666652545024	2016-03-30T17:42:10	JonCoppage Since that's where the low-wage, high-profit biz models are spitting out their excess cash.
jeffspross	715232575980044288	2016-03-30T17:41:49	JonCoppage Say, a tax system that deliberately goes after cap gains, dividends, corp profits and high CEO pay extra hard.
jeffspross	715232452554305536	2016-03-30T17:41:19	JonCoppage Doesn't make them definitively bad. But it does present problems/challenges that need to be answered w/ counterbalancing policy.
jeffspross	715232282081005568	2016-03-30T17:40:39	JonCoppage Which is that they subsidize/encourage low-wage, high-profit-margin business models. 
jeffspross	715232108352897024	2016-03-30T17:39:57	JonCoppage This Q deserves a nuanced treatment. But short answer is EITC &amp; wage subsidies all have the same weakness:

jeffspross	715229443136958464	2016-03-30T17:29:22	The EITC does not do this. "Moar education" definitely doesn't do this. So stop offering them as alternatives! 
jeffspross	715229248093495300	2016-03-30T17:28:35	But they key is that you must present some viable method for returning bargaining power to low income workers. That is the critical point.
jeffspross	715229059236495360	2016-03-30T17:27:50	But it's perfectly fair to say you don't like minimum wage as a solution for various reasons, and to agitate for one of those alternatives.
jeffspross	715228946380402688	2016-03-30T17:27:23	There are interesting debates to be had over which solution is optimal or more efficient.
jeffspross	715228761965236224	2016-03-30T17:26:39	And alternatives exist! There's big deficits via fiscal policy, looser monetary policy, experiments w/ MMT or helicopter drops, etc etc.
jeffspross	715228589646458880	2016-03-30T17:25:58	Listen everybody: If you don't like the minimum wage, you need an alternative method to boost aggregate demand and hit full employment.

jeffspross	714298624675590144	2016-03-28T03:50:37	Snyder just goes into Michael Bay chaos cinema mode during the action sequences. The movie doesn't quite gel as a result.
jeffspross	714298338062032896	2016-03-28T03:49:29	Like everyone else, I blame Zack Snyder. Dude knows how to say the moral notes, but not play them in all the little character beats.
jeffspross	714298059346296832	2016-03-28T03:48:23	Superman's weird indifference to civilian deaths in both Smallville fight and Metropolis finale are obvious examples of the problem.

jeffspross	714275279225511936	2016-03-28T02:17:51	HeerJeet Agreed. It's like an Edgar Rice Burroughs-based short film all by itself.
jeffspross	714270076363386881	2016-03-28T01:57:11	It's an oddly paced, out of nowhere sequence. And why did Clark need another Kryptonian ship? He already had one on the Kent farm.
jeffspross	714269220628860928	2016-03-28T01:53:47	But the stuff w/ the ship in the Arctic feels like Snyder decided to replace the Fortress of Solitude w/ a 15-min reference to "The Thing."

jeffspross	712709845145817094	2016-03-23T18:37:23	jeffspross We have a test case! Marriage is uncommon in Scandinavia, but lifelong civil partnership is. Grounded in economic foundation.
jeffspross	712708712746627072	2016-03-23T18:32:53	And certainly test that possibility before assuming "culture" or "values" or "gov't marriage programs" are the only options even available.
jeffspross	712708446265716737	2016-03-23T18:31:49	At least *test that possibility* before assuming lectures from the technocratic upper class are the fix for working class marriages.
jeffspross	712707749516337157	2016-03-23T18:29:03	Maybe the fix for marriage is to fix the foundations? At the very least, shouldn't we try that just to reduce our variables?
jeffspross	712707539222269953	2016-03-23T18:28:13	In the case of human relationships &amp; communities, those foundations would be plentiful employment, rising wages &amp; economic security.
jeffspross	712707281436192768	2016-03-23T18:27:12	I know this is a crazy thought, but bear w/ me: Maybe marriage is ecological. Like most ecologies, maybe it rests on material foundations.

jeffspross	711248385777340416	2016-03-19T17:50:04	To my mind, the problem is not that they lack the values but that they lack the concrete tools: jobs and incomes and so forth.

jeffspross	710565587978596353	2016-03-17T20:36:52	Yes. The whole conversation on this subject from both sides is unbelievably conceptually sloppy. 
jeffspross	710565165960278016	2016-03-17T20:35:11	9. I.E. we have to do the "ridiculous" thing, and change the static distribution.
jeffspross	710564924624273408	2016-03-17T20:34:14	8. In short, the only fix here is to actively change the proportional makeup of the slices themselves through policy.
jeffspross	710564791337689088	2016-03-17T20:33:42	7. If that proportional change happens faster than the change in overall size of the pie, then the slices become smaller in absolute terms.
jeffspross	710564653500276736	2016-03-17T20:33:09	6. But this only holds if inequality isn't increasing. If it is increasing, that means some slices are becoming proportionally smaller.
jeffspross	710564495374962688	2016-03-17T20:32:32	5. Now, economic growth may help, since even if the slice proportions don't change, every slice is bigger in absolute terms.
jeffspross	710563879223332865	2016-03-17T20:30:05	4. All that changes is who is in the 1% that gets the 40%, the 10% that gets the 20%, and so on, and how often people trade those positions.
jeffspross	710563690743881728	2016-03-17T20:29:20	3. So one slice is 40% of the pie but goes to 1% of the population, another slice is 20% and goes to 10%, and so on. That doesn't change.
jeffspross	710563334601383937	2016-03-17T20:27:55	2. More mobility simply means more people shifting in &amp; out of the diff "slices" of the pie more often. The slices themselves don't change.
jeffspross	710562884892241920	2016-03-17T20:26:08	1. So SpeakerRyan makes a very straightforward and fundamental logical error here.  
jeffspross	710558071920021504	2016-03-17T20:07:00	yeselson JoshuaMound nick_bunker Agreed. That is the big reason to hope the policy courage will come.

jeffspross	710122013726269440	2016-03-16T15:14:16	MattBruenig But they retain the movement groundwork they laid when they started small/local. Multiply that across the entire country.
jeffspross	710121830502293508	2016-03-16T15:13:32	MattBruenig That's kind of my point though. People start small/local and realize they gotta go big to win the prize.

jeffspross	710119403812208641	2016-03-16T15:03:53	Actually don't kill it. Sanders needs to stick it out to the convention &amp; shift the party platform. Just couldn't resist the GoT reference.

jeffspross	708718689655373824	2016-03-12T18:17:57	nberlat I also think universalism for welfare programs is itself a way to "confront racism directly,"...
jeffspross	708718458985435136	2016-03-12T18:17:02	nberlat American public schooling really doesn't have the distributive or governance structure of a genuinely universalist program.
jeffspross	708718262129922050	2016-03-12T18:16:15	nberlat I wouldn't hold up schooling as an example of a universal program. Funding mechanism is far too tied to neighborhood wealth.
jeffspross	708718110782693379	2016-03-12T18:15:39	nberlat ...either program to take them away from or reduce benefits for "undeserving" populations would be dead on arrival.
jeffspross	708717981254160384	2016-03-12T18:15:08	nberlat Both programs are now considered almost politically Untouchable. And I think it's fair to say any attempts to fool with...

jeffspross	708717487005769728	2016-03-12T18:13:10	nberlat I'll comment! I think the history of Social Security and Medicare (especially SS) is informative here.

jeffspross	707301136320045056	2016-03-08T20:25:06	eliasisquith brianbeutler There's enormous room to move leftward on econ issues in US politics. 
jeffspross	707300967314812928	2016-03-08T20:24:26	eliasisquith brianbeutler Sure. I dunno answer to that. But I do think we haven't even begun to test the Q yet.
jeffspross	707299759753719808	2016-03-08T20:19:38	brianbeutler Which part is backwards?
jeffspross	707299633836498945	2016-03-08T20:19:08	eliasisquith brianbeutler The same econ platforms that courts the Trumpites courts POC.

jeffspross	707279879507578883	2016-03-08T19:00:38	DaveMazella drvox Def ways Obama can be criticized. Just not clear how/if diff choices by him would've mattered. 
jeffspross	707276440882917376	2016-03-08T18:46:58	It honestly makes no sense for Trump to toe the GOP line on these issues. I wonder if he'll flip-flop in general? 
jeffspross	707272524585947137	2016-03-08T18:31:25	Half the reason liberals were pissed at Obama at the end of 2009 is he let Max Baucus negotiate health care for MONTHS to win GOP support.
jeffspross	707272185791049729	2016-03-08T18:30:04	We have ACTUAL VOTES THAT HAPPENED. Like, Obama BEGGED  Republicans for support on the stimulus.
jeffspross	707255657456467968	2016-03-08T17:24:23	Thanks! Not really sure how to summarize this one, so I'm reduced to just begging people to read it.

jeffspross	707240938129760256	2016-03-08T16:25:54	In 08, Obama recognized the ugliness that became Trumpism. But he didn't allow it to define those voters, either. 
jeffspross	707225318319394817	2016-03-08T15:23:50	5. I get it. I’m just a prof with a twitter account screaming into the void. Maybe John Oliver can convince ppl: 
jeffspross	707224978941452290	2016-03-08T15:22:29	4. This is actually something that BernieSanders, HillaryClinton could DO! It’s cheap, it’s important, it’s feasible. But we hear nothing.
jeffspross	707224571355774977	2016-03-08T15:20:52	3. A $4B fed grant—a rounding error in a $1.5T discretionary budget (0.3%)—would TRIPLE indigent defense budgets nationwide. But silence.
jeffspross	707224299476787201	2016-03-08T15:19:47	2. Can’t tweet this stat enough: state/local govts spend $2B on indigent defense (~1% of all cj spending).   While 80% of defs qualify.
jeffspross	707224015732088832	2016-03-08T15:18:39	1. Literally NO ONE has talked about this during the campaign. And “significant” for PD would be nothing for feds.

jeffspross	707230424716734464	2016-03-08T15:44:07	aDumbMick Well at the personal/social level, I think it's fair to say racism/tribalism are close to interchangeable.
jeffspross	707224451235115008	2016-03-08T15:20:23	aDumbMick I guess short version is I wouldn't call racism "inherent." But I think, like authoritarianism, it can be "latent."
jeffspross	707224115325833216	2016-03-08T15:19:03	aDumbMick This requires a long philosophic/theological discussion about human nature that Twitter is thoroughly ill-equipped to handle. :)

jeffspross	707023339706048512	2016-03-08T02:01:14	aDumbMick MyDogShotMe MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg The points are true, but they're a ways up the chain of abstract analysis.

jeffspross	707016488050401280	2016-03-08T01:34:01	aDumbMick MyDogShotMe MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg Gotta respect &amp; think about the difference if you want to talk to them about it.

jeffspross	707013829352431616	2016-03-08T01:23:27	aDumbMick MyDogShotMe MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg Well it's a different experience for one thing. When white workers allow racism...
jeffspross	706997282332278787	2016-03-08T00:17:42	MyDogShotMe aDumbMick MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg I was just putting those two effects into conceptually separate buckets.

jeffspross	706997051800756224	2016-03-08T00:16:47	MyDogShotMe aDumbMick MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg Right. That's what I meant.
jeffspross	706995824622866432	2016-03-08T00:11:54	MyDogShotMe aDumbMick MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg Like being denied job/housing/income/access/etc because your skin color marks you.
jeffspross	706995694934962176	2016-03-08T00:11:23	MyDogShotMe aDumbMick MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg Sure. But I meant first-order harms due directly to racism.

jeffspross	706994294335221760	2016-03-08T00:05:49	aDumbMick MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg Certainly true in theory. But what are concrete ways US white people are victimized by racism?
jeffspross	706992389403975681	2016-03-07T23:58:15	aDumbMick MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg (This should have been "most US white people are victims of oppressive systems.")
jeffspross	706991857977270272	2016-03-07T23:56:08	aDumbMick MeadBadger NostromoSerg kev_jg Do we mean "racism" as a purely interpersonal, so-&amp;-so said mean thing about so-&amp;-so matter?

jeffspross	706890768804220928	2016-03-07T17:14:27	aDumbMick Huh. There's been a long-term decline in male prime age participation. But up 'til 08 it was more than offset by female increase.

jeffspross	706872870073315328	2016-03-07T16:03:19	MeadBadger And with that, I must go write.
jeffspross	706872819926183936	2016-03-07T16:03:07	MeadBadger Since we're only human and have limited time/energy/etc, we have to admit some level of moral prioritization here.

jeffspross	706872478107197440	2016-03-07T16:01:46	MeadBadger But we're only human, so we rely on generalities a lot. And fighting for a more just world &gt; sensitivity-maximizing precision.
jeffspross	706872308233678848	2016-03-07T16:01:05	MeadBadger Here's my point in a nutshell: It would be great if everyone could speak w/ sensitivity-maximizing precision all the time.
jeffspross	706869519990398977	2016-03-07T15:50:01	MeadBadger ...etc etc have all been products of social systems that have rich white dudes at their privileged center?
jeffspross	706869333234835456	2016-03-07T15:49:16	MeadBadger Do you disagree that slavery, segregation, sexism, sexual harassment, militarism, colonialism, economic exploitation, poverty...

jeffspross	706866169169321984	2016-03-07T15:36:42	MeadBadger There are different modes of discourse. Sometimes it's diplomacy, and sometimes it's just critique. Diff goals for each.
jeffspross	706864637174624256	2016-03-07T15:30:37	MeadBadger Well I know they don't agree! I just think they're wrong and suffer from a failure of perspective.
jeffspross	706863445069574144	2016-03-07T15:25:52	MeadBadger So I think over-generalizing while punching up or punching sideways is way more forgivable than doing it while punching down.
jeffspross	706863289737687040	2016-03-07T15:25:15	MeadBadger Power/privilege are also very real things, and rich white dudes do sit at the top of that pyramid.
jeffspross	706863191725223937	2016-03-07T15:24:52	MeadBadger Lemme put it this way: I think PCness is overrated, and often used as a performance of personal virtue by bourgeois libs. BUT!
jeffspross	706861996965101570	2016-03-07T15:20:07	MeadBadger ryanlcooper I do think Trump has weirdly tapped into the way PCness is used to signal cultural superiority rather than to help.
jeffspross	706860960238010368	2016-03-07T15:16:00	MeadBadger ryanlcooper I think demanding everyone speak in sensitivity-maximizing specifics (like this ) is silly.
jeffspross	706859793412034562	2016-03-07T15:11:22	MeadBadger ryanlcooper ...rich white men have had, as a group, a pretty terrible influence on the world.
jeffspross	706859579385053185	2016-03-07T15:10:31	MeadBadger ryanlcooper I'm an upper class white male too! I just think, as a generalization, it's perfectly fair to say that...
jeffspross	706858786162479104	2016-03-07T15:07:22	ryanlcooper MeadBadger Yeah I'm fine w/ ripping on white males as long as the one doing the ripping isn't punching down the class ladder.
jeffspross	706852748000628737	2016-03-07T14:43:22	again not fully correct, but a rather uncomfortable amount of truth here, I think 
jeffspross	706619079948267521	2016-03-06T23:14:51	"Just say no" is the authoritarian’s version of a public-education campaign. There’s a whole worldview embedded in it.
jeffspross	706618850712772608	2016-03-06T23:13:57	From just about any angle — psychological, sociological, economic, political, moral — "just say no" was idiotic &amp; destined to fail.

jeffspross	705432181506752512	2016-03-03T16:38:33	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper I think you can force a lot of Trump voters to accept welfare state, as long as they're in on the deal.
jeffspross	705431719160193024	2016-03-03T16:36:42	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper True, but SS/Medicare also go to "others" as well. 
jeffspross	705431102555557888	2016-03-03T16:34:15	nberlat Racism prevented SS from being extended to AAs initially. But now that it has been extended it's basically politically untouchable.
jeffspross	705430954194690049	2016-03-03T16:33:40	nberlat True. This is why I think targeting welfare programs based on need is a bad idea. Universalism better. 
jeffspross	705429715964796928	2016-03-03T16:28:45	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper Put another way, Trumpists clearly trust SS/Medicare. Why is that?
jeffspross	705429613628014593	2016-03-03T16:28:20	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper Sure, but what does that mean? What caused mistrust? What sustains it? What's its structural nature?
jeffspross	705427738472157184	2016-03-03T16:20:53	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper (Other than pissing off the Mike Bloomberg donor class, I guess.)
jeffspross	705427672231505920	2016-03-03T16:20:37	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper I'm more optimistic on possible effectiveness. But yes. It's right thing to do and there's no downside.
jeffspross	705426844380762112	2016-03-03T16:17:20	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper I think it's also Dems didn't step into the vacuum w/ econ proposals that could appeal to them.
jeffspross	705426147740426244	2016-03-03T16:14:34	eliasisquith ryanlcooper yeselson Exactly. And now that compromise is coming apart.
jeffspross	705425992886697984	2016-03-03T16:13:57	ryanlcooper yeselson eliasisquith Frank was onto something important, but didn't frame it well.
jeffspross	705425834547552256	2016-03-03T16:13:19	ryanlcooper yeselson eliasisquith And outside the South, Dems basically split white working class vote w/ GOP.
jeffspross	705425759582736384	2016-03-03T16:13:01	ryanlcooper yeselson eliasisquith Basically, LOTS of poor &amp; working class people vote Dem despite being socially con.
jeffspross	705425652556697600	2016-03-03T16:12:36	ryanlcooper yeselson eliasisquith Also true.
jeffspross	705425182161248256	2016-03-03T16:10:44	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper Frank made a lot of good points but was also pretty confused about dynamics he was noting.
jeffspross	705425028452581376	2016-03-03T16:10:07	yeselson eliasisquith ryanlcooper Right. That's not the best state to demonstrate his thesis!
jeffspross	705424530479706114	2016-03-03T16:08:08	eliasisquith ryanlcooper And that the cleavage is racial animosity specifically, rather than "social issues" broadly.
jeffspross	705424359582797825	2016-03-03T16:07:28	eliasisquith ryanlcooper Frank is sort of correct, as long as you realize he's talking about southern working class whites specifically.

jeffspross	705417117269495808	2016-03-03T15:38:41	ryanlcooper econjared Edsall And that's achieved by the large welfare state and full employment policies that conservatism opposes.
jeffspross	705416993969573888	2016-03-03T15:38:12	ryanlcooper econjared Edsall I think it's more that Chamber of Commerce style conservatism can only thrive when prosperity is shared.
jeffspross	705415722365640704	2016-03-03T15:33:08	Needless to say I think all of this is exactly right.   
jeffspross	705415309092478976	2016-03-03T15:31:30	And here's econjared talking to Edsall about how the GOP coalition collapsed.

jeffspross	705252378572935168	2016-03-03T04:44:04	tedfrank normative True. My guess is Trump has no idea what the current regulatory framework is, at the state or federal level.
jeffspross	705250285078372352	2016-03-03T04:35:45	yeselson What I mean is, isn't Trump describing the way it works now?
jeffspross	705249139811028993	2016-03-03T04:31:12	As in, having to comply w/ each state's individual regulatory requirements is precisely what prevents cross-state competition, right?

jeffspross	705234083878666240	2016-03-03T03:31:22	yeselson JonCoppage Yeah. Honestly, I think the most important function unions serve is mass organizing for the macro policies...
jeffspross	705232301618274304	2016-03-03T03:24:17	yeselson JonCoppage So unless WRM doesn't think tighter labor markets would help wages either, I don't see how his argument holds.
jeffspross	705232225449713664	2016-03-03T03:23:59	yeselson JonCoppage I.E. there's no surplus labor left to bring in, so wages have to go up.
jeffspross	705232014610456577	2016-03-03T03:23:09	yeselson JonCoppage I was thinking mainly that unions sort of mimic at a sectoral or regional level the effect of tight labor markets.
jeffspross	705230794520924162	2016-03-03T03:18:18	yeselson JonCoppage In which case, some form of welfare state redistribution is the only alternative, and reformocons are in real trouble.
jeffspross	705230627784806401	2016-03-03T03:17:38	yeselson JonCoppage I'd add that if WRM is right, then it will basically be impossible to squeeze higher wages out of the job market.

jeffspross	704440450485264384	2016-02-29T22:57:45	MattBruenig jackmjenkins Idea would be GOP ditches Trump voters, moderates on social issues, and goes full libertarian on economics.
jeffspross	704439671858794496	2016-02-29T22:54:40	MattBruenig jackmjenkins You could imagine populist Dems vs libertarian GOP and southern whites just sit politics out for the most part.
jeffspross	704439237274431490	2016-02-29T22:52:56	jackmjenkins MattBruenig ... and peels off enough upper class voters from Obama coalition to win.
jeffspross	704439110929354756	2016-02-29T22:52:26	jackmjenkins MattBruenig I don't see how GOP survives long-term unless it becomes party of Michael Bloomberg...
jeffspross	704438914438852610	2016-02-29T22:51:39	jackmjenkins MattBruenig Yeah only populist workers party that could win is a multiracial one. That's so far outside the GOP's capacities.
jeffspross	704437693703458816	2016-02-29T22:46:48	MattBruenig jackmjenkins I see the argument. Workable white/black majority coalition against Latinos strikes me as super unlikely though.
jeffspross	704437162549321730	2016-02-29T22:44:42	MattBruenig jackmjenkins Trump needs current GOP coalition, including donor class + some WWC Dems, etc to win this year.
jeffspross	704436811158966273	2016-02-29T22:43:18	MattBruenig jackmjenkins Yeah, I don't think Trump has a prayer of creating a cross-race class-based realignment big enough to win.
jeffspross	704435791682998272	2016-02-29T22:39:15	jackmjenkins MattBruenig I can't decide which would be better/worse: GOP going full donor class libertarian or full white nationalist.
jeffspross	704435157223211010	2016-02-29T22:36:43	jackmjenkins Whether the collapse occurs before or after President Trump's tenure is the question.
jeffspross	704435068098506752	2016-02-29T22:36:22	jackmjenkins Yeah, I think that translates to massive but temporary collapse of GOP's electoral fortunes.
jeffspross	704434600496513029	2016-02-29T22:34:31	Doubtful. Design of US system can't handle more than two major parties. Any schismatics will be absorbed somewhere.

jeffspross	703645538244145152	2016-02-27T18:19:04	I confess I rather enjoy watching Marco Rubio get into the swing of things here. 
jeffspross	703644014407331840	2016-02-27T18:13:00	It's technically true. But it's also a total black box. We simply have no idea if a full negative assault would matter, or by how much.
jeffspross	703643818428493824	2016-02-27T18:12:14	I also think the point that Trump hasn't faced a full negative assault yet is exactly like that point when it comes to Sanders:
jeffspross	703643506405838848	2016-02-27T18:10:59	Basically agree, but I'd remove the "very." And if there's a recession before November, all bets are off.

jeffspross	702992191455682563	2016-02-25T23:02:54	bradymakesstuff drvox I think elite denial of Trumpism is much more about the conviction the masses' economic straights can't be THAT bad.
jeffspross	702987861973401600	2016-02-25T22:45:41	drvox If you're not giving people an economic platform worth fighting for, for some their reactionary tribalism is all that's left.
jeffspross	702987527737712640	2016-02-25T22:44:22	drvox This is what annoys me about the "maybe they're not economically embattled, maybe they're just racist" talking point.
jeffspross	702987382489014276	2016-02-25T22:43:47	drvox Human beings suck. But whether the parts of them that suck drive their votes depends on what options you give them to vote for.
jeffspross	702986820410327042	2016-02-25T22:41:33	drvox And you'd probably lose some Bloomberg-style Dems too depending on how the GOP reacts to the shift.
jeffspross	702986604432982016	2016-02-25T22:40:42	drvox Right. Maybe some southern ones too. But that's admittedly a much harder wall to breach.
jeffspross	702985470280646656	2016-02-25T22:36:11	drvox Because we're all upper class here, &amp; it's the upper class that prioritizes the social issues / ID politics &amp; votes accordingly.
jeffspross	702985232648110081	2016-02-25T22:35:14	drvox Frankly, I think the reactionary tribalism of the masses is over-played in DC circles.
jeffspross	702984806133530625	2016-02-25T22:33:33	drvox But I think there's a lot more room to use econ populism to build a slightly different/bigger coalitional mix than many realize.
jeffspross	702984581943861250	2016-02-25T22:32:39	drvox It's not a cure all. The white working class in the South specifically is probably unreachable.

jeffspross	702182883042000897	2016-02-23T17:26:59	jamespoulos Dunno. My guess is both bases would react very well to "gov't should hire a bunch of people to revamp national infrastructure."

jeffspross	702178351876706304	2016-02-23T17:08:59	jamespoulos Yes I think there's a lot to that. Fact that "full employment" has disappeared from discussion in both parties is maddening.
jeffspross	702177487380295681	2016-02-23T17:05:33	jamespoulos Fair. But per that WaPo link I just sent, I think it's hard to argue "pro-market" policies are near the top of that idea list.
jeffspross	702176999020756992	2016-02-23T17:03:37	jamespoulos Ostensibly, perfect "pro-market" policies could still have the exact same result in terms of white working class jobs, etc.

jeffspross	700807810121146369	2016-02-19T22:22:56	because of course the colleague I spoke to is right. Most jobs aren’t worth not outliving. We should all work less to live more.
jeffspross	700807421674004481	2016-02-19T22:21:24	and for a wealthy developed country this is, I think, a really impt near-term political project—both to provide jobs &amp; reduce working hours.

jeffspross	700760706472226816	2016-02-19T19:15:46	Totally agree. Sanders (And Clinton!) should be arguing that now is an appropriate time for bigger deficits.

jeffspross	700751009224781824	2016-02-19T18:37:14	This is an excellent big-picture defense of Bernie Sanders’ economic plan  
jeffspross	700748485734236160	2016-02-19T18:27:12	As usual, averages are bad, because they tend to get thrown off by outliers.
jeffspross	700748391593046016	2016-02-19T18:26:50	The 5.3% number seems to come from averaging the first decade. I think the graph shows why that's a deceptive &amp; unhelpful way to do it.
jeffspross	700748180678275072	2016-02-19T18:26:00	That is still very high. But it's no where near as absurd as 5.3% a year in perpetuity.
jeffspross	700747794814881792	2016-02-19T18:24:28	The analysis shows a big initial burst, but then the economy stabilizes around 3.8% per year for the long haul.

jeffspross	700729690026160128	2016-02-19T17:12:31	ChrisMctwtr rev_avocado That's a political feasibility problem. I agree it's a huge hurdle! But it's not an economic projection problem.

jeffspross	700728713864843264	2016-02-19T17:08:38	seatacAtMcDnlds But they were not crazy, nor were they deceitful.
jeffspross	700728652393123840	2016-02-19T17:08:24	seatacAtMcDnlds Sanders analysis made assumptions about multipliers, HC cost inflation rate, etc that I would not have made. Too rosy.
jeffspross	700728532129837057	2016-02-19T17:07:55	seatacAtMcDnlds Agreed, but so far I see no danger of anyone lying about details.
jeffspross	700727922089308161	2016-02-19T17:05:30	"US gov't system is terrible, &amp; designed to stymie progress" should be a parenthetical in every article re: politicians' broken promises.
jeffspross	700724839573639168	2016-02-19T16:53:15	alanzilberman Don't tweet, really.
jeffspross	700724556495892480	2016-02-19T16:52:07	That thing where you start a tweetstorm and then realize that, like Damon Lindelof, you have no idea how to end it.
jeffspross	700724299389272064	2016-02-19T16:51:06	18. There's a big difference between a good framework with unrealistic numbers, and a bad framework with unrealistic numbers.
jeffspross	700723259629707264	2016-02-19T16:46:58	17. This does not even get us to the massive moral difference between Sanders "unrealism" and GOP "unrealism." 
jeffspross	700722940803821568	2016-02-19T16:45:42	16. The size of the effect is highly debatable. What isn't debatable is that the basic shape of his program will promote growth.
jeffspross	700722757156229120	2016-02-19T16:44:58	15. Sanders is proposing a massive infrastructure stimulus, universal provision of health care, college, paid leave, etc.
jeffspross	700722625845198848	2016-02-19T16:44:27	14. The idea that this basic framework could promote high growth is completely ridiculous, as a matter of basic macroeconomics.
jeffspross	700722494731194368	2016-02-19T16:43:56	13. They massively cut high end taxes, then implicitly decimate government spending and aid.
jeffspross	700722261892816896	2016-02-19T16:43:00	12. A big part of what makes GOP claims of high growth so ridiculous is the basic shape of what they're doing.
jeffspross	700722125435371520	2016-02-19T16:42:28	11. But this gets us to the other point. The Sanders analysis really isn't *completely* crazy. See tweetstorm: 
jeffspross	700721741581029376	2016-02-19T16:40:56	10. Now, there is obviously a limit to how much you can downplay details/realism.
jeffspross	700719484403892225	2016-02-19T16:31:58	support for a Bowles-Simpson "grand bargain" is heavily correlated with income  
jeffspross	700719819411173378	2016-02-19T16:33:18	9. The key thing is the GOP does not *bargain with itself* beforehand, and that is where Sanders does emulate them.
jeffspross	700719669582245888	2016-02-19T16:32:42	8. But so far I see no evidence that Sanders has a "Point Two" problem. Indeed, his history in the Senate shows he's happy to bargain.
jeffspross	700719401033576448	2016-02-19T16:31:38	7. Point Two is where you get into trouble. Some on the left think we could have passed single-payer in 2008, which strikes me as nuts.
jeffspross	700719179289092096	2016-02-19T16:30:45	6. But Point One is arguably very good politics! Long-term aspiration is how you build and sustain movements.
jeffspross	700719030584225792	2016-02-19T16:30:10	5. The stuff on how Sanders wants to make Dems more like GOP is all about Point One. 
jeffspross	700718731236802561	2016-02-19T16:28:58	4. Two, they've proven extraordinarily bad at taking half loaves and compromises when stymied in pursuit of those goals.
jeffspross	700718552421011456	2016-02-19T16:28:16	3. One, they've organized around a specific set of ambitious goals, and don't spend much time worrying about details or feasibility.
jeffspross	700718046688768001	2016-02-19T16:26:15	2. The GOP, it seems to me, has done two things.
jeffspross	700717981702041601	2016-02-19T16:26:00	1. I want to elaborate on this point with a few more distinctions. 
jeffspross	700715133849341953	2016-02-19T16:14:41	.ryanlcooper really nails what's so aggravating about liberal wonk response to Sanders.  
jeffspross	700713765625434113	2016-02-19T16:09:15	FYI, for overly rosy future economic projections, CBO  &amp; the Fed  are serial offenders.

jeffspross	700695915900702720	2016-02-19T14:58:19	That the GOP plans are unrealistic is a lot less offensive than what they'd do to human beings if they were realistic.
jeffspross	700695656801808385	2016-02-19T14:57:17	Odd to suggest GOP plans' great sin is outlandish growth projections. Those implied spending cuts would also wreck millions of lives, FYI.

jeffspross	700486200721854464	2016-02-19T01:04:59	Wouldn't it have been easier to just take Trump? 
jeffspross	700479098775146496	2016-02-19T00:36:46	hoodedu It should! :) That was a good piece.
jeffspross	700478663423168512	2016-02-19T00:35:02	Incidentally, Barry Goldwater also lost to a popular incumbent presiding over an economic boom.
jeffspross	700478515418763268	2016-02-19T00:34:26	Comparing Sanders' campaign to Mondale or McGovern is silly.  
jeffspross	700476727760322561	2016-02-19T00:27:20	To my mind, this is far and away the most bizarre aspect of the Democratic primary so far.  
jeffspross	700475298265968640	2016-02-19T00:21:39	Aware of the irony of tweeting a "social media is terrible" argument. Gonna do it anyway.  
jeffspross	700473840095227905	2016-02-19T00:15:52	At the same time, the feelings of Barney Frank (and everyone else eyerolling at Sanders) aren't relevant, either.
jeffspross	700473654144991234	2016-02-19T00:15:07	So I get why Barney Frank feels the way does. Politics is a contact sport that relies on often-ugly mass social psychology.
jeffspross	700473412498489344	2016-02-19T00:14:10	US has disgraceful levels of poverty &amp; inequality. This whole argument is about best way to serve the millions suffering those realities.
jeffspross	700472840143839232	2016-02-19T00:11:53	But "understandable on a human level" isn't the same as "relevant to a campaign or political/policy dispute."
jeffspross	700472470139043840	2016-02-19T00:10:25	On a human level, I totally get how people would react this way.

jeffspross	700444442835206144	2016-02-18T22:19:03	2 questions for economists discussing Sanders' plan: how big do you think is the output gap? What do you think is the fiscal multiplier?
jeffspross	700444138076909568	2016-02-18T22:17:50	kdrum paulkrugman But the first decade average was always gonna be considerably higher than the long-term growth trend.
jeffspross	700444014479159296	2016-02-18T22:17:21	kdrum paulkrugman The economy is still well below capacity. Probably wouldn't be as big as the analysis finds.
jeffspross	700443865694666753	2016-02-18T22:16:45	kdrum paulkrugman Because there's a big one time growth burst at the start. Which isn't a crazy assumption.
jeffspross	700442790212206592	2016-02-18T22:12:29	paulkrugman kdrum The analysis does not project 5% growth for a decade. 
jeffspross	700440634222473216	2016-02-18T22:03:55	hoodedu No it's an argument that this stuff is hard.
jeffspross	700440210333511680	2016-02-18T22:02:14	Skeptical but fair take on the Sanders economic analysis. (Ignore the Slate-esque headline.) By JHWeissmann: 
jeffspross	700439837157908480	2016-02-18T22:00:45	hoodedu And you can pile enough unremarkably sunny assumptions on top of each other until you get really remarkable results.
jeffspross	700439641711730688	2016-02-18T21:59:58	hoodedu No one lied. This was a good faith effort using standard modeling. It just inherently involves a lot of assumptions.
jeffspross	700439393123721216	2016-02-18T21:58:59	hoodedu Generally speaking, the expertise is what's called upon to defend the priorities.

jeffspross	700438707686354944	2016-02-18T21:56:16	hoodedu I don't think you separate that trend from the fact that the people who are generally Trump supporters have in fact...
jeffspross	700437900958109696	2016-02-18T21:53:03	DemFromCT I think the Q is, when does the "briefing book" actually get written? Historically, it seems to get written after the campaigns.
jeffspross	700437291764830208	2016-02-18T21:50:38	DemFromCT I meant fix it in terms of the numbers for the CBO score. Not in terms of actually passing policy.
jeffspross	700437042044411906	2016-02-18T21:49:38	hoodedu Their coalition combines different tribes whose interests are completely at odds, and the contradiction is becoming too acute.
jeffspross	700436861315973120	2016-02-18T21:48:55	hoodedu But the GOP's impasse has nothing to do with respect for data or wonkery! It has to do with coalition failure.
jeffspross	700436470536937472	2016-02-18T21:47:22	If Sanders actually won, he'd have a whole infrastructure of policy people behind him, who could fix this stuff before CBO scored it.
jeffspross	700436290697695233	2016-02-18T21:46:39	Well that could be a problem. But I think episodes like ACA show policymaking tends to smooth out rougher promises made during campaigns.
jeffspross	700436088368680961	2016-02-18T21:45:51	That said, if a campaign locks you into certain promises in policymaking, and those promises run you smack into an embarrassing CBO score...
jeffspross	700435898228289540	2016-02-18T21:45:06	So clearly, history shows wonkery is of limited usefulness when it comes to the goals campaigns are supposed to meet.
jeffspross	700435733601849344	2016-02-18T21:44:27	I think a lot of people are forgetting that getting any economic projections of a campaign platform at all is exceedingly rare.
jeffspross	700435439644114944	2016-02-18T21:43:16	Less flippantly, I think we need to think harder about what's smart politics during campaigns vs what's smart politics during policymaking.

jeffspross	700380373876801537	2016-02-18T18:04:28	AuburnParks I know. My point is there's a distinction between demand and capacity. Ability to spend w/out limit only affects demand.

jeffspross	700360710673399808	2016-02-18T16:46:20	Anyway. Skepticism of the analysis is totes justified. But the analysis deserves respect as the far upper optimistic bound of the plausible.

jeffspross	700358576569606145	2016-02-18T16:37:51	seatacAtMcDnlds nytimeskrugman I think it depends on what's causing the secular stagnation. Summers focuses on chronic demand shortage.
jeffspross	700358272306384896	2016-02-18T16:36:38	Our situation is far less dire than the mid-1930s. So again, Sanders analysis is VERY optimistic. But in the range of the plausible.
jeffspross	700358009633927168	2016-02-18T16:35:36	It ranged well over 10% multiple years in a row. The Sanders analysis has it touch 10% one year, and then fall to 3.8% by end of decade.

jeffspross	700356032581636097	2016-02-18T16:27:44	The plain truth is no one - not paulkrugman, not the CBO - actually knows how big or small the output gap is.

jeffspross	700025249039974401	2016-02-17T18:33:19	JHWeissmann That said, this does assume you're dumping a massive new infrastructure bill, single-payer, and everything else in Sanders'...
jeffspross	700025124670410752	2016-02-17T18:32:50	JHWeissmann Yeah, Friedman used a really high multiplier that year which Jared Bernstein told me was too high.
jeffspross	700024363735601152	2016-02-17T18:29:48	Actually, here's a better chart. That it's real GDP growth rate is now in the title. Deleting the other one. 
jeffspross	700022977706926080	2016-02-17T18:24:18	MattBruenig Real or nominal?
jeffspross	700022699561611264	2016-02-17T18:23:12	But I do think the overall shape of the effect in Friedman's analysis is more reasonable than the "5.3% GDP growth!" talking point suggests.
jeffspross	700022515343593472	2016-02-17T18:22:28	In 2026, real GDP growth rate is still 3.8% annually, which still strikes me as quite high, even given Sanders' new entitlement spending.
jeffspross	700022169435176960	2016-02-17T18:21:05	A big burst initially, followed by a slow wind-down. Basically the path you'd expect given the $1T infrastructure plan, etc.

jeffspross	697838677892816896	2016-02-11T17:44:40	rev_avocado Yeah, I'm not confident arguing Sanders is more electable. Just that he's not less electable.

jeffspross	697833294185041920	2016-02-11T17:23:17	Agreed. Also that maybe the Trump campaign on the other side has pushed the envelope of legitimate electability. 
jeffspross	697831160198529025	2016-02-11T17:14:48	rev_avocado Dunno. I honestly think "electability" is tea leaf reading. No one knows anything.
jeffspross	697830615693955073	2016-02-11T17:12:38	Because I think the argument that Clinton has been forced to contort herself to appease rampant sexism is totally on point.
jeffspross	697830464661270528	2016-02-11T17:12:02	FWIW, I think the way out of this pickle is to admit the "Clinton is more electable than Sanders" argument is foolish and drop it.

jeffspross	697812364284919809	2016-02-11T16:00:07	15b. I should also ad: deficit spending in the form of public works and infrastructure investment and direct job creation thru gov't.
jeffspross	697811359422001152	2016-02-11T15:56:07	DecentFilms The point of leftists politics for me is to achieve *freedom from* material forces for as many people as possible.
jeffspross	697811155222339584	2016-02-11T15:55:18	DecentFilms That economics and material forces basically rule social phenomena I think is true. It is not something I *like.*

jeffspross	697810486369263617	2016-02-11T15:52:39	DecentFilms The point is to give people the necessary economic support so that their marriages *can* be based on "the feels" as it were.
jeffspross	697810336204763136	2016-02-11T15:52:03	DecentFilms I completely agree material conditions and economic interests matter enormously.
jeffspross	697810245632921600	2016-02-11T15:51:41	DecentFilms What I'm objecting to is the idea of taking aid away from people in order to coerce them into marriages.
jeffspross	697809853780070400	2016-02-11T15:50:08	17. Put its first-order priorities together, and conservative economics is basically a car engine design to eat itself. &lt;/fin&gt;
jeffspross	697809631695908864	2016-02-11T15:49:15	16. I assume you all see the problem.
jeffspross	697809577690005504	2016-02-11T15:49:02	15. In particular, lots of deficit spending in the forms of programs that favor lower income Americans, in order to boost consumption.
jeffspross	697809413483024384	2016-02-11T15:48:23	14. And the two big ones are... wait for it... loose monetary policy and lots of deficit spending.
jeffspross	697809275976953856	2016-02-11T15:47:50	13. But at this point, we also have a pretty good idea about what policy tools are needed to create full employment. 
jeffspross	697808833133973505	2016-02-11T15:46:05	12. Now, I'm a big fan of full employment! I agree we should be working hard to reach and sustain it.
jeffspross	697808069569310720	2016-02-11T15:43:03	.jeffspross Employer / market charity is the only acceptable option, b/c it's opt-in (like DanPriceSeattle) or opt-out (like most others)
jeffspross	697808293914214401	2016-02-11T15:43:56	11. The problem is that full employment is really hard to achieve. It's been basically absent for 40 years. 
jeffspross	697808076221452288	2016-02-11T15:43:04	10. Also under full employment, no worker is left out of the bargaining unit, as happens with unions.
jeffspross	697807979823804418	2016-02-11T15:42:41	9. Under full employment, no job creation is constrained by regulatory wage floors or UI benefits.
jeffspross	697807822927433729	2016-02-11T15:42:04	8. But I think you can deduce from the above what those circumstances are: full employment.
jeffspross	697807701196210177	2016-02-11T15:41:35	7. Conservatives rarely lay out what those circumstances are, I think because they haven't done much self-examination on this, frankly.
jeffspross	697807432223838208	2016-02-11T15:40:31	6. But my main point is that when you run thru the logic, conservatives only accept wage gains for workers under very specific conditions.
jeffspross	697807279882547202	2016-02-11T15:39:54	5. Interestingly, you can get wage hikes from the EITC, which makes life easier *on employers* by subsidizing low wage business models.
jeffspross	697806862352195589	2016-02-11T15:38:15	4. They can't come from unions, because inefficiency and closed shops are unfair and organized labor is incipiently Stalinist or something.
jeffspross	697806525377617920	2016-02-11T15:36:54	3. They can't come from minimum wage hikes, because that's an "artificial price floor."
jeffspross	697806419764969472	2016-02-11T15:36:29	2. They can't come from bargaining power via the safety net, because that discourages employers and job creation.
jeffspross	697806297090011136	2016-02-11T15:36:00	1. On this note, talking to conservatives I've noticed an incredible persnicketiness re: where wage hikes come from.

jeffspross	697465012814798848	2016-02-10T16:59:51	SeanMcElwee I think this backs up what I'm saying, especially if you consider Cruz the avatar for the Tea Party. (Which I think we should.)

jeffspross	697461217762418689	2016-02-10T16:44:47	SeanMcElwee dylanmatt I'd argue that's more a function of how economic, social, &amp; ID politics change differently as you move up income.

jeffspross	697457752327778304	2016-02-10T16:31:00	dylanmatt SeanMcElwee Dunno about this. Tea party is high-income, high-education compared to median. Trump support is opposite.
