jonathanalgar	707997318092607488	2016-03-10T18:31:29	nickkounis fwred but under "factored in" methodology they would account for that in expectations? Perhaps I'm missing your point.
jonathanalgar	707994659138703361	2016-03-10T18:20:55	nickkounis fwred confused. announce stimulus in conjunction w/ staff forecast where +2yr HICP &lt;1.7% tantamount admitting not doing enough?
jonathanalgar	707992423457300480	2016-03-10T18:12:02	If so, big change relative to previous (Mar-15) methodology and the main reason for the 1.6% LT inflation forecast. 
jonathanalgar	707989606814367744	2016-03-10T18:00:50	CBPP3 completely distorted covered mkt: drained secondary liquidity, squeezed primary allocations. No wonder IG corp investors apprehensive.
jonathanalgar	707972995827048448	2016-03-10T16:54:50	confordpark lots on the Go[lang] programming language, not so much the board game. Find anything useful TheStalwart?
jonathanalgar	707970952060149762	2016-03-10T16:46:43	TomHale_  low—that’s why I don’t see at much of an elephant, even if you assume TLAC will have negative impact on lending.
jonathanalgar	707967594377158658	2016-03-10T16:33:22	TheEIU_Europe no expert on FX market structure, but I thought pairs above all a function of relative expectations for short-term rates.
jonathanalgar	707965207553908736	2016-03-10T16:23:53	TomHale_ what proportion of EZ SME lending is via G-SIBs?
jonathanalgar	707962631122980864	2016-03-10T16:13:39	Eva_M_Taylor fwred what does "partially" mean? Why was this not explained in staff forecast document?
jonathanalgar	707960807636733954	2016-03-10T16:06:24	TheEIU_Europe diagree—10bp depo cut already priced in and Draghi's statement on further cuts very carefully worded.
jonathanalgar	707957611279294464	2016-03-10T15:53:42	Ankit_Tweets 
jonathanalgar	707955905204133888	2016-03-10T15:46:55	One thing for sure: within six months we'll really understand to what extent structural factors are impeding EZ bank lending.

jonathanalgar	707943455595560961	2016-03-10T14:57:27	Total ECB TLTRO II allowances = 30% of eligible loans as at Jan-16 (€4881bn) - stock TLTRO take-up (€212bn) = €1252bn
jonathanalgar	707938011183505408	2016-03-10T14:35:49	Draghi does not exclude helicopter money, rather he defines it as an "interesting concept", which they have not studied as yet.
jonathanalgar	707937174281457666	2016-03-10T14:32:29	TLTRO II deets: 
jonathanalgar	707935866447142912	2016-03-10T14:27:18	Bank lending data elevated to the alpha and omega of Eurozone statistics.
jonathanalgar	707933286555893760	2016-03-10T14:17:02	"majority overwhelming", said with a wry smile.
jonathanalgar	707932972117331969	2016-03-10T14:15:47	Wouldn't it have been easier to just publish the bloody TLTRO details at 2:30pm?
jonathanalgar	707926858759852033	2016-03-10T13:51:30	fwred just to point out that the projections only partially reflect the expected impact of today's measures
jonathanalgar	707930816140148736	2016-03-10T14:07:13	Is this all a bit on the hoof? Draghi says no decision on whether to buy IG financial non-bank bonds. Committees to look into it.
jonathanalgar	707929955364118528	2016-03-10T14:03:48	jonathanalgar limits currency war bla-bla. the really clever thing is TLTRO -ve deposit gains linked to balance sheet expansion. TSF-lite.
jonathanalgar	707929728896929794	2016-03-10T14:02:54	Constancio loves the counterfactual.
jonathanalgar	707929517466251268	2016-03-10T14:02:04	"Emphasis will shift from rates to other non-conventional instruments" smart—strong signal scope to increase QE further if needed.
jonathanalgar	707929330161205248	2016-03-10T14:01:19	Exactly: German savings banks still crying, understandably so. 
jonathanalgar	707927788716695552	2016-03-10T13:55:12	Clever structure. Should mitigate concern about carry trade ("handing money to banks") 
jonathanalgar	707926251198148608	2016-03-10T13:49:05	Here's the full introductory statement 
jonathanalgar	707925712683081728	2016-03-10T13:46:57	ECB staff projection for 2018 HICP at 1.6% only!! Supposed to account for expected effects of today's measures. Über dovish.
jonathanalgar	707925489185398785	2016-03-10T13:46:03	Draghi: Annual HICP inflation at 0.1% in 2016 [from 1.0% in Dec], 1.3% in 2017 [from 1.6% in Dec] and 1.6% in 2018
jonathanalgar	707925250865020928	2016-03-10T13:45:07	Seems bizarre to publish TLTRO technical details *after* the press conference, how can journalists scrutinise and question?
jonathanalgar	707923882192334848	2016-03-10T13:39:40	Just on agencies &amp; supras—not sovereigns. 
jonathanalgar	707916041200996353	2016-03-10T13:08:31	When will ECB start buying IG corps? Remember it announced inclusion of regional debt in December and hasn't yet bought any.
jonathanalgar	707915102721331200	2016-03-10T13:04:47	Be very interesting how Draghi justifies inclusion of IG corps. And what level of monthly purchases targeted.
jonathanalgar	707910390089388032	2016-03-10T12:46:03	BBG: *ECB LOWERS BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE TO 0.000%
jonathanalgar	707907269174886400	2016-03-10T12:33:39	I wonder if ECB will finally get round to announcing details of one if its key December measures (including regional debt in PSPP) today.
jonathanalgar	707905801407635456	2016-03-10T12:27:49	More on "Queen backs Brexit" story: in 2015 BES data 66% of women over 65 without a univ educ &amp; who live in public housing back Brexit!
jonathanalgar	707616273111367680	2016-03-09T17:17:21	Very good column by rodrikdani on failure of "centrist technocrats" to admit culpability for today's problems 
jonathanalgar	707648870789079041	2016-03-09T19:26:52	ECB doing more Brexit contingency planning than UK Government. 
jonathanalgar	707556582574399488	2016-03-09T13:20:09	DanielaGabor nicolas_veron who knows? You can’t see what is on the top of the hat.
jonathanalgar	707549096291278848	2016-03-09T12:50:24	nicolas_veron small steps up the feather towards federalism (top of the hat).
jonathanalgar	707540496915234817	2016-03-09T12:16:14	Bruegel_org thanks.
jonathanalgar	707538168611016704	2016-03-09T12:06:59	Bruegel_org not sure if it's only me, but audio seems to have a lot of feedback.
jonathanalgar	707359881939054596	2016-03-09T00:18:32	Trying to figure how best to phrase "Do you mind if I get up at 4am to watch an AI play GO?" to my girlfriend 
jonathanalgar	707352929573969925	2016-03-08T23:50:55	rorybroomfield OK, perhaps I misunderstood. I heard that markets are insulated from Brexit risk because they are hedged against it.
jonathanalgar	707339959959724032	2016-03-08T22:59:22	Best thing about Sun front page claim that the Queen supports Brexit is that on page 2 it demands her actual opinion 
jonathanalgar	707344179899322368	2016-03-08T23:16:08	So when is "The Five Presidents Report: A Critical Analysis" hitting VoxEU? 
jonathanalgar	707327531603652609	2016-03-08T22:09:59	rorybroomfield for anyone who knows anything about markets, your segment on EdConwaySky made no sense at all.
jonathanalgar	707238584865177600	2016-03-08T16:16:33	Watch live: EU Cmttee questions legal experts on the process of leaving the EU Brexit EUreferendum: 
jonathanalgar	707246757789491201	2016-03-08T16:49:01	Terrifying statistic. Remember Slovakia is not just EU, but EZ. 
jonathanalgar	707243346994073605	2016-03-08T16:35:28	DanielaGabor *OK, which was a product of EZ institutional inadequacy. To what extent has ECB been able to unwind that with OMT/QE?
jonathanalgar	707240558855585792	2016-03-08T16:24:23	DanielaGabor but that's just a product of Germany's superior credit risk profile? Another reason why so urgent to fix imbalances
jonathanalgar	707221778435874817	2016-03-08T15:09:46	DanielaGabor when you say "attacking".. thought it consensus desirable to wean banks off over-reliance on domestic sov debt for liquidity.
jonathanalgar	707221397291048960	2016-03-08T15:08:15	Very skewed. RTRS: CYPRUS GOVT BONDS AT RISK OF FALLING OUT OF ECB'S QUANTITATIVE EASING AFTER EXITING BAILOUT AT END MARCH -ECB SPOKESMAN

jonathanalgar	707205752168046592	2016-03-08T14:06:05	Brave new world. German lender BerlinHyp just got paid to borrow money.
jonathanalgar	707192529343684608	2016-03-08T13:13:32	GrantLewis1 tomashirstecon _Financeguy even among smarter Brexiters, oft fundamental misunderstanding about regs 
jonathanalgar	707179755955732480	2016-03-08T12:22:47	nicolas_veron sure—though think it was particularly succinctly put here. Which reminds me, need to read your PIIE piece on EDIS.
jonathanalgar	707168500503224320	2016-03-08T11:38:03	The EMU stalemate in a headline. BBG: *SCHAEUBLE: MUST CUT BANK UNION RISKS BEFORE MUTUALIZING RISKS

jonathanalgar	706875877691408385	2016-03-07T16:15:17	(Cue rumpus over whether or not was due to political pressure; fresh concerns over Bank of Portugal supervisory independence)

jonathanalgar	706794595208843264	2016-03-07T10:52:17	charlesforelle poorly phrased on my part. But that they have evaluated cost of insurance is interesting none the less.

jonathanalgar	706426180317093888	2016-03-06T10:28:20	Brexiteers had years - years - to hone common arguments, get lines straight, plan for this referendum. What were they doing all that time?
jonathanalgar	706471161551577089	2016-03-06T13:27:05	danielfyork BBCJonSopel said in context of R voters (so limited BME)? But still not true: Turmp not winning among those w/ degrees, for eg

jonathanalgar	705850534457167872	2016-03-04T20:20:56	RajaKorman _Financeguy AdamPosen think cost of Brexit in terms of bolstering anti-EU populist sentiment (even within EZ) far higher.

jonathanalgar	705846692499816448	2016-03-04T20:05:40	RajaKorman _Financeguy AdamPosen had similar concern: , for eg, but think final text sufficiently flexible..
jonathanalgar	705845518212198400	2016-03-04T20:01:00	_Financeguy good point. If PTAs distort and lead to sub-optimal external outcomes, from his logic we'd likely get raw deal.
jonathanalgar	705844047584301056	2016-03-04T19:55:09	_Financeguy —regrettably beyond me. Would like to see a retort from a trade expert like AdamPosen, RajaKorman,..
jonathanalgar	705843930965909504	2016-03-04T19:54:41	_Financeguy of course. Whole piece seems vacant of any consideration for role of standards in trade, which is probably the deeper floor.
jonathanalgar	705838923453472770	2016-03-04T19:34:47	_Financeguy i.e. US-DE has flourished [in relative terms, vs FR-DE] despite no comprehensive preferential trade arrangement.
jonathanalgar	705836379851382786	2016-03-04T19:24:41	_Financeguy my interpretation of last three paras is: if the economics of a bilateral trade flow makes sense, it will inevitably flourish.
jonathanalgar	705826830897573888	2016-03-04T18:46:44	(2) Simplistic. EU governance more balanced and [evidently] resilient than he writes. And improving. 
jonathanalgar	705826586797457408	2016-03-04T18:45:46	(1) "single mkt initiatives have ceased to provide dividends" defeatist. If EU can get service based integration right, for eg, huge boon.
jonathanalgar	705826391858782210	2016-03-04T18:45:00	Most thought provoking pro-Brexit piece I've read. Though disagree, two main reasons:

jonathanalgar	705436170642132992	2016-03-03T16:54:24	Romney attacking Trump as useful as Blair attacking Coybyn—nobody who supports is listening and everybody else already knows.
jonathanalgar	705434286049140736	2016-03-03T16:46:54	A lot of my pro-Brexit friends are also deeply skeptical of Whitehall's ability to get things done. V inconsistent.
