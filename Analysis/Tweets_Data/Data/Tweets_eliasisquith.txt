eliasisquith	713525562623533057	2016-03-26T00:38:45	kalebhorton i first got into it when i was in college. blew my mind that someone could make a funny *&amp; empathetic* show about loneliness
eliasisquith	713524607765061632	2016-03-26T00:34:57	kalebhorton there was an almost radical humanism/universalism to it. at times it could be downright spiritual (which is *insane*!)
eliasisquith	713522938658627585	2016-03-26T00:28:19	kalebhorton Something I was thinking about today is how there are basically no heroes or villains in the show. There's only people
eliasisquith	713522650161803266	2016-03-26T00:27:11	kalebhorton &amp; it's so honest about relationships (family, basically). there's love &amp; hate &amp; neither one ever permanently conquers the other
eliasisquith	713522137223577606	2016-03-26T00:25:08	Also immediately thought of that final fight/reconciliation btwn Hank &amp; Larry/Art. It's a genuinely funny &amp; beautiful scene kalebhorton

eliasisquith	709752719150546944	2016-03-15T14:46:49	theseantcollins ryanlcooper deep_beige agree. but dont think one's conscience is what matters most here (if it conflicts w/ stopping GOP)
eliasisquith	709751932496322560	2016-03-15T14:43:41	deep_beige ryanlcooper i mean, i dont think an NPR hit stops Trump; but I also don't think we want this to be simple show of force either
eliasisquith	709751587133063168	2016-03-15T14:42:19	theseantcollins ryanlcooper deep_beige i.e., it's not usually an issue unless concern trolls make it one?
eliasisquith	709751341137174533	2016-03-15T14:41:20	deep_beige ryanlcooper is the problem the terms or the fact that they want to be the ones doing it? radicals can write op-eds too!

eliasisquith	709750715346980864	2016-03-15T14:38:51	deep_beige ryanlcooper right. so long as that's defined as outside realm of "protest" worth defending, no downside
eliasisquith	709750272617267200	2016-03-15T14:37:06	deep_beige ryanlcooper if the protesters are well-organized i think it reduces the chances (but some will do it either way, def)
eliasisquith	709749934061445120	2016-03-15T14:35:45	ryanlcooper deep_beige &amp; that's a hypothetical. absent that, seems no-brainer
eliasisquith	709749795804606464	2016-03-15T14:35:12	ryanlcooper deep_beige the only risk i see is that the protests are numerous/wild enough that "both sides" narrative takes hold
eliasisquith	709749411899904001	2016-03-15T14:33:40	deep_beige ryanlcooper altho it's worth noting that if media turns it into college PC thugs vs. Trump thugs that helps triangulators

eliasisquith	709748542215163904	2016-03-15T14:30:13	ryanlcooper sure. but that's diff than saying you think fascism is not really preferable to liberal democracy w/out welfare state!

eliasisquith	709409594280431618	2016-03-14T16:03:22	why are you so worthless? Support
eliasisquith	709409076954996736	2016-03-14T16:01:18	Couldn't agree with David more 
eliasisquith	709407399556173828	2016-03-14T15:54:38	On the issue of disrupting Trump rallies, for me the question is purely utilitarian. Since disruption aids Trump, not a good tactic.
eliasisquith	709398531031830528	2016-03-14T15:19:24	By 2-to-1, the Fla voters who say Trump's Chicago rally affected their vote say it made them more likely to back him 
eliasisquith	709396237984899073	2016-03-14T15:10:17	It's been said that anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools. Maybe that explains Trump's supposed economic populism
eliasisquith	709395592083066880	2016-03-14T15:07:43	Here we go! 
eliasisquith	709387918108921856	2016-03-14T14:37:14	You know when the fire alarm goes off in your office and everyone just sits there because they assume it's a drill? 
eliasisquith	709388295222878208	2016-03-14T14:38:44	Incidents of racial violence at or after Trump rallies are piling up. Feels like the end of reconstruction... 
eliasisquith	709383115035287552	2016-03-14T14:18:08	Finally, some good news 
eliasisquith	709384606718533633	2016-03-14T14:24:04	jeffspross DavidKaib semantics. but either way i dunno how else you'd make an argument about a thing that hasn't happened before/ever
eliasisquith	709383428399980544	2016-03-14T14:19:23	jeffspross DavidKaib here:  plenty of evidence being marshaled there. maybe wrong, but it exists
eliasisquith	709382308281917440	2016-03-14T14:14:56	jeffspross ive seen many pieces that use public opinion polling to make arguments that he's less electable
eliasisquith	709381441084383232	2016-03-14T14:11:29	jeffspross evidence-free?
eliasisquith	709372962139459585	2016-03-14T13:37:48	CoreyRobin I'm skeptical. But was interested to see Frank willing to go on-record with that. He's taken lotta heat for HRC support already
eliasisquith	709370890958426114	2016-03-14T13:29:34	Because your timeline is flooded with John Oliver clips, I wrote about the left's misplaced faith in its comedians

eliasisquith	709367670613929984	2016-03-14T13:16:46	imillhiser wednesday so you can use the "they want trump to decide instead?" talking point to full effect
eliasisquith	709367036762263552	2016-03-14T13:14:15	When Trump's voters hear he is a sleazy profiteer, they say: "Good. Be a sleazy profiteer ON MY BEHALF": 
eliasisquith	709365979613163520	2016-03-14T13:10:03	GMPaiella nice. personally, i woke my partner up at 5:30 this morning because i was apparently shouting "help! help!" in my sleep
eliasisquith	709365563240411137	2016-03-14T13:08:24	Yep. One small bit of interest: Barney Frank (strong HRC supporter) suggests she "can't" walk back TPP opposition 
eliasisquith	262778952114905088	2012-10-29T04:52:39	to tell how corrupt the MSM is, note that even David Limbaugh, always rational, has lost his temper more than once.

eliasisquith	709343762158321664	2016-03-14T11:41:46	Inspired by Shapiro's example, David Duke to issue public denunciation of KKK for "sullying" Gen. Stonewall Jackson's small gov't philosophy
eliasisquith	709342309779959808	2016-03-14T11:36:00	elongreen yes. he penned a terrible written public message about bullies and sullying breitbart's legacy &amp; everything
eliasisquith	709341588657459200	2016-03-14T11:33:08	Courageous of Ben Shapiro to belatedly disown the hub of white supremacism &amp; homophobia he helped build b/c it was hurting his shitty brand
eliasisquith	709243245021237248	2016-03-14T05:02:21	Glad people at Breitbart have woken up to fact they worked for a garbage site but it's like leaving communist party over Stalin in 1991.

eliasisquith	709332155155947520	2016-03-14T10:55:39	Trump voters: "He says what I want to."  After the 'Back to Africa/Off to Auschwitz' stuff, it's clear they're now saying what he wants to.
eliasisquith	707283244350369793	2016-03-08T19:14:00	I have an article in the NewRepublic today: "How Liberals Tried to Kill the Dream of Single-Payer"

eliasisquith	709179323606024192	2016-03-14T00:48:21	This whole rant is 👌🏻 
eliasisquith	709179010689986560	2016-03-14T00:47:06	Oh, I don't know if that contract is necessarily so implicit. Could be read as GOTV boilerplate 
eliasisquith	709162660898672640	2016-03-13T23:42:08	but even if it's been that way for 100s of years, it's not sustainable. at some pt the polity makes a choice. millions wont like result
eliasisquith	709162138200350720	2016-03-13T23:40:03	at no point in american history has debate between cosmopolitan &amp; ethno-nationalist definition of what it means to be american been resolved
eliasisquith	709161764630433793	2016-03-13T23:38:34	now that GOP has congress but still cannot shake country like etch-a-sketch and return to circa 2004 Trump seems to many only choice left
eliasisquith	709161514310225921	2016-03-13T23:37:35	and worth remembering that this is after the GOP won full control of congress in 2014. lots of voters saw that as GOP elite's final chance
eliasisquith	709161296516816896	2016-03-13T23:36:43	for millions of americans the realization that this. is. really. happening. (and that there's no going back) triggered new spasm of rage
eliasisquith	709161149397393409	2016-03-13T23:36:08	I don't think anyone should ever ignore the fact that this is happening after nearly 8 years of a black president named barack hussein obama
eliasisquith	709159845044297728	2016-03-13T23:30:57	Been waiting for this jbouie piece to hit for a while now. It was worth it: 
eliasisquith	709156656114999296	2016-03-13T23:18:16	This jbouie essay on Trumpism as racist backlash to Obama era getting widely praise, deservedly so. It's excellent: 
eliasisquith	709148753987510273	2016-03-13T22:46:52	where is the 65 y/o white guy who owns a few autoshops &amp; never went to college &amp; has a confederate flag bumper sticker version of mandela?
eliasisquith	709147804158001153	2016-03-13T22:43:06	i think it's about time to demand that moderate white americans of good will stage a march or rally against trumpism &amp; all it represents
eliasisquith	709145798190170114	2016-03-13T22:35:08	ugh just realized someone out there is working on a thinkpiece about how trump is irony's fault

eliasisquith	709111322055561216	2016-03-13T20:18:08	This notion that liberals need to do XYZ because conservatives can't be tamed is pervasive and wrong.

eliasisquith	709108354166235136	2016-03-13T20:06:20	Don't focus on Trump. Like yelling at cancer. Focus on GOP leaders wondering if they could make it work so long as they wore a hazmat suit

eliasisquith	708754867251183616	2016-03-12T20:41:43	bendreyfuss so youre saying you just engaged in libel?
eliasisquith	708754060493647872	2016-03-12T20:38:30	bendreyfuss did he say something?
eliasisquith	708743900421206016	2016-03-12T19:58:08	I've angered Johnny Sack from the Sopranos. This will not end well. 
eliasisquith	708732907943272448	2016-03-12T19:14:27	If Romney campaign folks think this story of how they "corralled" Trump makes them look good, they're wrong: 
eliasisquith	708711279498805248	2016-03-12T17:48:30	I noted how closely Trump was copying Wallace back in August, but it's even more evident now.

eliasisquith	708706121314344961	2016-03-12T17:28:01	Way to go, slugger!

eliasisquith	708669016215314433	2016-03-12T15:00:34	Because the way other GOPers have responded would suggest not
eliasisquith	708668781564960768	2016-03-12T14:59:38	I'm seeing some on my TL worrying about Trump benefitting from this overall. Is that how cable news is playing it?
eliasisquith	708667475550928896	2016-03-12T14:54:27	Starting to feel like 2016 is 1968 but in a universe where Wallace wins the GOP nomination

eliasisquith	708646008931143683	2016-03-12T13:29:09	dwdavison9318 yes. ppl are ok w/ managed politics/politics as sports. but *real* politics - ie change! -  many voters (disprop. $) hate
eliasisquith	708645411486109697	2016-03-12T13:26:46	SophiaTesfaye they keep thinking they're in the general already, my best guess. but youre right - no matter what it's dumb as hell
eliasisquith	708644913018179588	2016-03-12T13:24:47	dwdavison9318 the weird thing about US is that for all its self-identification as the most democratic of nations most ppl hate politics
eliasisquith	708644654137384961	2016-03-12T13:23:46	multiple people have pointed out that the message is likely intended for anti-Trump GOPers, rather than weak supporters. that sounds right
eliasisquith	708639571098124288	2016-03-12T13:03:34	ICUDrEd elongreen yeah i think it's going to be a white dude
eliasisquith	708638439982428160	2016-03-12T12:59:04	ICUDrEd elongreen b/c whether or not she wins whoever that is will be well positioned to be next nominee &amp; influence party elite direction
eliasisquith	708638239716990976	2016-03-12T12:58:16	ICUDrEd elongreen yeah i was about to say that one thing i hope the sanders campaign can ensure - at the least - is a liberal VP
eliasisquith	708638113288089600	2016-03-12T12:57:46	ICUDrEd elongreen i myself think they're bougie centrists w/ some liberal sympathies but i get why ppl might wonder after stuff like this
eliasisquith	708637352588083200	2016-03-12T12:54:45	parabasis cd_hooks elongreen phew. good thing bill isn't one of the chief strategists &amp; decision-makers w/in the campaign
eliasisquith	708636685123330048	2016-03-12T12:52:06	ICUDrEd elongreen exactly. and the fact that they seem so eager to do it makes people suspect that it's what they actually believe
eliasisquith	708636442424115200	2016-03-12T12:51:08	cd_hooks parabasis elongreen time to draft justin trudeau imo
eliasisquith	708636184076021761	2016-03-12T12:50:06	ICUDrEd elongreen parabasis i think the young activists she's going to need notice this stuff tho
eliasisquith	708635717837189120	2016-03-12T12:48:15	ICUDrEd elongreen parabasis &amp; i think stuff like this definitely hurts her in that respect
eliasisquith	708635663332196352	2016-03-12T12:48:02	ICUDrEd elongreen parabasis no but unless the gop just literally collapses (possible!) she needs enthusiasm/turnout from O base
eliasisquith	708635450194464768	2016-03-12T12:47:11	last pt &amp; then ill stop ranting: it's too late in the campaign for them to still be having days like they did yesterday
eliasisquith	708635171935928320	2016-03-12T12:46:05	elongreen parabasis if he were secretly giving them advice that they were following, can you imagine? even the O ppl would retch
eliasisquith	708635070786093056	2016-03-12T12:45:41	elongreen parabasis they have all but promised he is not involved so not only would that be dumb but legit scandalous (on L at least)
eliasisquith	708634784264790016	2016-03-12T12:44:33	elongreen parabasis actually i suppose it gets us into pretty thin reed territory more than silver lining words

eliasisquith	708631595461320704	2016-03-12T12:31:52	Clinton's response seems more concerned about the fact that protesters fought back than with the racism and nativism of Trump's rallies.

eliasisquith	708439650596212738	2016-03-11T23:49:09	5) Gay people had no party on their side &amp; no one to represent or speak for them fr halls of power. ACT UP protested Democrats continually.
eliasisquith	708439421880815618	2016-03-11T23:48:15	4) What Clinton said perfectly encapsulated the viewpoint of mainstream Democrats in the 1980s, before the party became gay friendly
eliasisquith	708438971441946624	2016-03-11T23:46:27	3) There was a mainstream, and then there were the margins. And the margins were much more distant from the center than they are today.

eliasisquith	707541613136973824	2016-03-09T12:20:40	I do believe Sanders' ideas represent the future of the party -- *if* the left learns from his campaign how to solidify &amp; grow coalition

eliasisquith	707538854350299136	2016-03-09T12:09:42	eliasisquith perhaps it reflects a range of political positions among AAs. More conservative in the south. Role of churches, etc.

eliasisquith	707527551795785730	2016-03-09T11:24:48	So what's the theory about why Sanders won MI? Are his huge gains with AAs the reason?
