delrayser	699615724357165056	2016-02-16T15:26:01	ezraklein I share your worry. That said, you do think "polarization" is the best way to describe the cause? Implies a two-sided problem.

delrayser	699609588967022592	2016-02-16T15:01:38	ezraklein But I take your point to be that, from the GOP's perspective, it's not illogical for them to exploit the system that way.
delrayser	699609233378164736	2016-02-16T15:00:14	ezraklein But that aside, I just don't think "let's dispense with the norms that permit our government to function" is a "valid" argument.
delrayser	699608954691829761	2016-02-16T14:59:07	ezraklein I'm not sure that the fact that the system depends on informal norms makes it "illogical."
delrayser	699606843941916673	2016-02-16T14:50:44	ezraklein Right, which is why I was a little surprised when you called the argument "totally valid."

delrayser	684430655665602562	2016-01-05T17:45:59	140 characters is arbitrary, and only happened because of SMS, but by random stroke of luck it made Twitter special.
delrayser	684430293902733313	2016-01-05T17:44:32	Think of any in-person conversation. Does one person speak 10,000 characters, then the next? No. We exchange sentences.
delrayser	684430176588017665	2016-01-05T17:44:04	Here's the thing: the reason Twitter is a CONVERSATION is inextricably tied to the 140-char limit. Get rid of that, the conversation dies.
