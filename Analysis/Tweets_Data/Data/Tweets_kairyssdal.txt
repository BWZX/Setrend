kairyssdal	695456161072451586	2016-02-05T03:57:24	Agree. Completely.

kairyssdal	695454713781706753	2016-02-05T03:51:39	Okay, wait, chucktodd just said they're going to squeeze in 'as many questions as they can'? What. The Hell.
kairyssdal	695454344401924097	2016-02-05T03:50:11	Do we have a final tally on 'progressive.'?
kairyssdal	695454263351185408	2016-02-05T03:49:51	I'm with Fallows. 
kairyssdal	695454123676684288	2016-02-05T03:49:18	TonyFratto I guess my point is that it's easy for our leaders - POTUS *and Congress - to commit us to something they simply do not share in
kairyssdal	695453793664659456	2016-02-05T03:47:59	Chaos. Cats and dogs living together.  
kairyssdal	695453678468091905	2016-02-05T03:47:32	I KNOW!

kairyssdal	695452779070926849	2016-02-05T03:43:58	Huh. Flint. Politics. That is all.
kairyssdal	695452624011730945	2016-02-05T03:43:21	okay, so wait, they're still talking and it's 90+ minutes here...

kairyssdal	695452019650199552	2016-02-05T03:40:57	I thought this was a 90-minuter

kairyssdal	695439532758429698	2016-02-05T02:51:19	I believe Hillary Clinton is progressive. I also believe she never, ever wanted to be dragged so insanely far to the left in a primary.
