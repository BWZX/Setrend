pradeeepk	691162641213992960	2016-01-24T07:36:29	Sparticuszorro Fritz_100 I just don't understand market obsession with oil...there Natgas here with the best recovery potential..
pradeeepk	691162317518573569	2016-01-24T07:35:12	Sparticuszorro Fritz_100 I missed lower associated gas production from oil wells...that's 10% of total supply
pradeeepk	691162192075366400	2016-01-24T07:34:42	Sparticuszorro Fritz_100 the industry cannot supply at current curve...I would say spot should be atleast 3.50 for any supply growth
pradeeepk	691161914433413121	2016-01-24T07:33:36	Sparticuszorro Fritz_100 which is my point. 1)there's no glut in the first place 2)u have LNG Mexico exports coming up 3)coal substitution
