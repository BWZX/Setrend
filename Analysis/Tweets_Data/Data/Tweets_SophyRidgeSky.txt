SophyRidgeSky	684309822670548993	2016-01-05T09:45:50	Hilary Benn - ever polite - has just wished me a Happy New Year, but giving nothing away on the reshuffle
SophyRidgeSky	684308661834018816	2016-01-05T09:41:13	In a way Benn staying makes sense, damage already done re Syria, Eagle more of future concern re Trident. Tho wd risk Corbyn looking weak
SophyRidgeSky	684304771528978432	2016-01-05T09:25:45	Sounds like Jeremy Corbyn is aiming to have his reshuffle done &amp; dusted by the 12.45 Shadow Cabinet meeting
SophyRidgeSky	684300098021539844	2016-01-05T09:07:11	Jeremy Corbyn will finish having reshuffle discussions this morning, and full Shadow Cabinet announcements expected are today
SophyRidgeSky	684297961816330240	2016-01-05T08:58:42	HelenHells3 oh I always love a good reshuffle 😉
SophyRidgeSky	684296983775985664	2016-01-05T08:54:49	Shadow Cabinet is still in the diary for 1245 today... Will the new Labour team be ready by then?
SophyRidgeSky	684281970961035264	2016-01-05T07:55:09	A day of stairwells and reshuffles. What it was like for me and SophyRidgeSky waiting on the news that never came: 
SophyRidgeSky	684272939647283200	2016-01-05T07:19:16	Simon Danczuk says he is concerned that Ken Livingstone might prejudice Labour's investigation into him, but he's "quietly confident"
SophyRidgeSky	684272736810713088	2016-01-05T07:18:28	Simon Danczuk tells GMB he's an "ordinary guy who does politics" and others - like Boris Johnson - also have a "colourful personal life"
SophyRidgeSky	684269746649481218	2016-01-05T07:06:35	LibbyKerensky clevan because reshuffles nearly *always* leak
SophyRidgeSky	684268085315006464	2016-01-05T06:59:59	jpfallon27 that's my hunch too...
SophyRidgeSky	684266861685534721	2016-01-05T06:55:07	I 💘 this from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg BeTheNerd 
SophyRidgeSky	684264170255200256	2016-01-05T06:44:25	SophyRidgeSky Incredibly, it seems Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle is (on the surface) going to plan... meetings yesterday, announcements today
SophyRidgeSky	684130124690767872	2016-01-04T21:51:46	NCanham potentially
SophyRidgeSky	684129845241077760	2016-01-04T21:50:40	stephenkb well, if Corbyn hadn't survived that *would* have been big news

SophyRidgeSky	684125793694388226	2016-01-04T21:34:34	SophyRidgeSky I'm trying to work out if that's because everything is going to plan or nothing is...
SophyRidgeSky	684125678523006976	2016-01-04T21:34:06	7.5hrs into the Labour reshuffle. It may be rather long, but it's also impressively non-leaky....
SophyRidgeSky	684073456451874816	2016-01-04T18:06:36	reshuffle &amp; Barry Gardiner trending in UK. Just in case anyone still thinks Twitter is a guide to what the actual world is interested in.
SophyRidgeSky	684051697933676544	2016-01-04T16:40:08	PeteNorth303 glad to please ;-)

SophyRidgeSky	684036381606297600	2016-01-04T15:39:16	Barry Gardiner doesn't confirm to waiting journos that he's got a job... But he doesn't deny it either.... reshufflerumours
SophyRidgeSky	684035746538336261	2016-01-04T15:36:45	Nero thanks
SophyRidgeSky	684033935328841728	2016-01-04T15:29:33	Hilary Benn,of course, is big one to watch in reshuffle. Other Shad Cab members have told me they'll consider their positions if he's sacked
SophyRidgeSky	684033461544464385	2016-01-04T15:27:40	Could BarryGardiner - Miliband's special envoy on climate change - be going to DECC as lisanandy moves to Shadow Defence brief? reshuffle
SophyRidgeSky	684032292621291520	2016-01-04T15:23:01	The latest MP seen going into Jeremy Corbyn's office is BarryGardiner (which may be because his office is nearby...)
SophyRidgeSky	684030421328359424	2016-01-04T15:15:35	NEW: Labour have now actually placed someone on the stairwell to make sure that no journalists are hanging around outside Corbyn's office.
SophyRidgeSky	684024388442845184	2016-01-04T14:51:37	EXACT Corbyn quote to us: 'Excuse me guys do you mind not hanging around outside my office door, could you all leave please.'
SophyRidgeSky	684023915505676288	2016-01-04T14:49:44	Jeremy Corbyn has just asked us to leave: "Do you mind not hanging out outside my office door?"
SophyRidgeSky	684022060029468674	2016-01-04T14:42:22	Worth watching Lisa Nandy in Corbyn reshuffle.... Here's what I wrote about her in September 
SophyRidgeSky	684018508594806787	2016-01-04T14:28:15	Chief Whip Rosie Winterton has gone into the Leader's Office reshuffle
SophyRidgeSky	684011027504218112	2016-01-04T13:58:31	Corbyn has just arrived in parliament to begin reshuffle meetings with shadow cabinet members at 2:30.
SophyRidgeSky	684006226670280704	2016-01-04T13:39:27	Shadow Cabinet members telling me they don't expect extensive reshuffle &amp; Hilary Benn could stay. Not long til we find out if they're right
SophyRidgeSky	684004758101880833	2016-01-04T13:33:37	SophyRidgeSky so it now seems the reshuffle will be done and dusted by then...
SophyRidgeSky	684003224756555776	2016-01-04T13:27:31	Some reshuffle conversations are likely to be on the phone as not everyone is in Westminster (Burnham is in his constituency, for example)
SophyRidgeSky	683996481431441408	2016-01-04T13:00:43	Jeremy Corbyn having one on one conversations with some Shadow Cabinet members today, tho not everyone has heard - and some aren't in London
SophyRidgeSky	683995061076537345	2016-01-04T12:55:05	A leak from Labour's shadow cabinet is, of course, inconceivable 
SophyRidgeSky	683994571953549312	2016-01-04T12:53:08	Jeremy Corbyn meeting Shadow Cabinet members to discuss reshuffle later today, but official announcements likely tomorrow (unless they leak)
SophyRidgeSky	683992310435201025	2016-01-04T12:44:09	I understand Jeremy Corbyn will start having initial conversations with Shadow Cabinet members later today about the reshuffle
SophyRidgeSky	683980430870188032	2016-01-04T11:56:57	Since 2015's political predictions were so accurate(!!)here's how Corbyn's reshuffle cd look  
SophyRidgeSky	683976494822064128	2016-01-04T11:41:18	PM's spokeswoman: 11 air strikes have been carried out in Syria since the vote, including on check points south of Raqqa on Christmas Day
SophyRidgeSky	683976264533852160	2016-01-04T11:40:23	PM's spokeswoman on Saudi Arabia: PM has been very clear about the importance of engaging with countries..so we can raise matters of concern
SophyRidgeSky	683975536977248257	2016-01-04T11:37:30	PM's spokeswoman says IS video is "a propaganda tool" and not all has been true in the past. Publishing is a "decision for editors to make"
SophyRidgeSky	683960435310215168	2016-01-04T10:37:29	Trump vs Clinton: The row over sexism just got dirty says SophyRidgeSky  
SophyRidgeSky	683941734712250368	2016-01-04T09:23:11	There's a Shadow Cabinet scheduled for tomorrow lunchtime... so Jeremy Corbyn is likely to either cancel it or complete reshuffle by then...
