davidgregory	708143195968950272	2016-03-11T04:11:09	Rubio made strong case for himself tonight - less Interested in contrast w Trump.
davidgregory	708143002577936384	2016-03-11T04:10:23	Trump tired to take focus off him saying to GOP establishment there are millions behind me - join me. Smart politics.
davidgregory	708136593459179520	2016-03-11T03:44:55	Phew, back to the polls.

davidgregory	708136081401761794	2016-03-11T03:42:52	Wow, Trump advocates bucking GOP rules. Whoever has most delegates should win.
davidgregory	708135181845204992	2016-03-11T03:39:18	It's interesting to hear these candidates on stage talking about the social context for why people resort to violence at Trump events.
davidgregory	708134652477841409	2016-03-11T03:37:12	Crowd size matters.
davidgregory	708133832067846144	2016-03-11T03:33:56	I think debate tonight has more sober tone which is good for GOP brand. Cruz has drawn most contrast with Trump.
davidgregory	708132509616312320	2016-03-11T03:28:41	Trump might find the book Red Notice about Putin's Russia interesting
davidgregory	708131997588316160	2016-03-11T03:26:39	Putin has been a strong leader for Russia - Trump. That sounds like admiration for a tyrant.

davidgregory	708129750225690625	2016-03-11T03:17:43	On many topics, Trump says do what the Democrats are doing but do it better. Drives more ideological conservatives nuts but many like it.
davidgregory	708129722325192704	2016-03-11T03:17:36	Trump has not mentioned a poll once tonight. A huge difference from other debates
davidgregory	708129024057470976	2016-03-11T03:14:50	I have a hankering for a steak right now
davidgregory	708125913918083072	2016-03-11T03:02:28	.davidgregory you're reading the debate all wrong. real Donald Trump showing restraint &amp; poise. Making strong case for how deals get done

davidgregory	708127251875889152	2016-03-11T03:07:47	And then US has no role post ISIS in region? Is that a real policy?
davidgregory	708126957385424897	2016-03-11T03:06:37	Trump - knock out ISIS fast and then come home. What happens in the region next? And how do you knock them out without ground troops?
davidgregory	708126306576310272	2016-03-11T03:04:02	Is anyone but Trump running for the nomination? They all sound like they're giving up. GOPdebate

davidgregory	708125006664998913	2016-03-11T02:58:52	Cruz has compared Trump to Hillary twice tonight.
davidgregory	708124771574292481	2016-03-11T02:57:56	Trump loves Israel like he loves New Hampshire and the poorly educated.
davidgregory	708124602220867584	2016-03-11T02:57:16	Parading for Israel.
davidgregory	708124373627105281	2016-03-11T02:56:21	Cruz has shown great skill in issuing a litany against Trump. Not just tonight.
davidgregory	708123730145366016	2016-03-11T02:53:48	Trump's anti Muslim views could explain some of his support among evangelicals, many of whom condemn basic tenets of Islam as violent v West
davidgregory	708122409795231745	2016-03-11T02:48:33	Strong answer from Rubio on Muslims who serve our military
davidgregory	708122062125146112	2016-03-11T02:47:10	"I mean a lot of them...." Trump on how many Muslims hate the US
davidgregory	708120634170204161	2016-03-11T02:41:30	Trump more evasive/incoherent than usual. Rivals are so far determined to be non confrontational, safe. Advantage: Trump. gopdebate
davidgregory	708121034440970240	2016-03-11T02:43:05	Forty minutes in, Rubio and Cruz seem afraid to challenge Trump. He, Trump, is as quiet and measured as I've ever seen him. Tick tock.
davidgregory	708120675794481152	2016-03-11T02:41:40	Cruz making a strong case about impact of tariffs on average consumers. Contrast with Trump fuming about China "behaving."
davidgregory	708117790583037952	2016-03-11T02:30:12	Trump apparently believes that we should only defend South Korea and Germany if we get paid to do so. Incredible.
davidgregory	708117993977421824	2016-03-11T02:31:00	This is what Trump has been trying to do for weeks, but his opponents haven't let him: try on his quieter, more reasonable, nominee persona.
davidgregory	708118251192995842	2016-03-11T02:32:01	Except Trump. But nothing matters. 
davidgregory	708118038265131009	2016-03-11T02:31:11	Cruz advancing the Bush proposal on SS personal accounts for younger workers. But is taking gutsy move of calling for raising retirement age
davidgregory	708116712357564416	2016-03-11T02:25:55	Talking about waste, fraud and abuse re SS instead of raising taxes or cutting benefits is a cop out.
davidgregory	708115957122732033	2016-03-11T02:22:54	Btw, by this point in the last debate Trump had already spoken extensively about his man parts.
davidgregory	708115519090642944	2016-03-11T02:21:10	On foreign policy, I'd like to know specifically what these candidates think the leadership lesson of the Iraq war is.
davidgregory	708115256585920514	2016-03-11T02:20:07	Trump's interested in staying above fray. He's playing out the clock. But others have a need to take the fight to the front runner, no?

davidgregory	694355546149883904	2016-02-02T03:03:57	Awesome person and journalist. Getting attention for the right reasons  
davidgregory	694355690492686337	2016-02-02T03:04:31	This is two minutes into first quarter. By April it will seem as distant as Crimean War.  
davidgregory	694355664387313664	2016-02-02T03:04:25	Projected GOP turnout 170k plus via FoxNews - huge. Very good for Trump? Or are Cruz and Rubio turning out new voters?
davidgregory	694354468758917120	2016-02-02T02:59:40	Breaking: everybody's always wrong about everything
davidgregory	694350093613469696	2016-02-02T02:42:17	Wow you are eloquent. It means Sanders at 48+ percent is quite a showing.  
davidgregory	694346904986066944	2016-02-02T02:29:37	Sanders is at 48%. I mean really.
davidgregory	694344842088947714	2016-02-02T02:21:25	And it's just the math. You take the establishment 4 and consolidate their support behind Marco and it adds up.  
davidgregory	694344609447723008	2016-02-02T02:20:29	No it's just a real dynamic out there. Trump could run the table but the "establishment" is going to look for an in 
davidgregory	694343042195668992	2016-02-02T02:14:16	Again if Rubio has a big night - even 3rd - he can make the case that one on one he could take down Trump.
davidgregory	694341730716536833	2016-02-02T02:09:03	If Rubio were to hit 20 percent tonight might some big GOP establishment figures pressure others to drop out and back him?
davidgregory	694334690824597504	2016-02-02T01:41:05	Not just interesting, could be devastating for Cruz. 
davidgregory	694333782229434368	2016-02-02T01:37:28	Interesting that Cruz and Trump are splitting evangelicals based on entrance polls via FoxNews
davidgregory	694327674521677824	2016-02-02T01:13:12	I cannot tie a bow tie or understand a caucus without checking the Internet.
