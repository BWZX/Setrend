michaelianblack	723730948525834240	2016-04-23T04:31:19	Anyway, heaven wouldn't be a necessary construct if people would just stop f-ing dying.

michaelianblack	723730065612263425	2016-04-23T04:27:48	meganphelps So interesting. Thanks for answering. Good talking again - going to sleep.
michaelianblack	723729608319852545	2016-04-23T04:25:59	rpapajeski So life's purpose is to live in a Christlike way for the purpose of encouraging others to do the same? I can see that.
michaelianblack	723728746025459712	2016-04-23T04:22:33	meganphelps Wouldn't *all* human emotion cloud your judgement? Aren't those emotions what make us human?
michaelianblack	723727847454564352	2016-04-23T04:18:59	Then why pursue earthly love at all? Why not devote oneself entirely to Christ without distraction? Being sincere.  
michaelianblack	723727540427350016	2016-04-23T04:17:46	meganphelps And do you think that attitude is common in religion or specific to WBC?
michaelianblack	723727308750761986	2016-04-23T04:16:51	meganphelps Hm. But if you knew he was being tormented somewhere would you still have been fine?
michaelianblack	723726458808635392	2016-04-23T04:13:28	meganphelps Wait - is all human affection sinful or just affection towards sinners? And aren't we all sinners?
michaelianblack	723726272967413760	2016-04-23T04:12:44	meganphelps That double sucks. Seems like that would get old pretty fast and then you'd be like, "I kind of miss Steve."
michaelianblack	723725630152564736	2016-04-23T04:10:11	meganphelps Well, that sucks.
michaelianblack	723725057957236736	2016-04-23T04:07:54	meganphelps So you exist insomuch as you believe and do not exist insomuch as you do not.
michaelianblack	723724811936104449	2016-04-23T04:06:55	JrRodeoDaredevl Might be a misunderstanding in my part. That's what I thought defined heaven.
michaelianblack	723724334884392960	2016-04-23T04:05:02	meganphelps Ah! Like disowning. For all intents and purposes, you don't exist. We don't mourn that which never was.
michaelianblack	723724069389123584	2016-04-23T04:03:58	meganphelps It specifies those who worship the beast - does this include non-believers who don't worship any God?
michaelianblack	723723347696214016	2016-04-23T04:01:06	meganphelps That's interesting - is there communication between them? Again, I'm being total lot sincere. Trying to understand this.
michaelianblack	723722869008687104	2016-04-23T03:59:12	meganphelps Or is it more like that person is so utterly lost to the righteous that they do not know his pain?
michaelianblack	723722650661588992	2016-04-23T03:58:20	meganphelps Can those in hell ever escape? And aren't the people who loved him also in a kind of hell knowing he suffers?
michaelianblack	723721365392601088	2016-04-23T03:53:14	There has to be the ability to reflect, which we can't do without some measure of pain. No? 
michaelianblack	723721101206016000	2016-04-23T03:52:11	How is there even awareness of heaven's bliss? Seems like you can't without some sense of self, and if there is self 
michaelianblack	723720932020379648	2016-04-23T03:51:30	So then is heaven purposeless? Does you just exist within it in a state of nothingness, in which case... 
michaelianblack	723720737568251904	2016-04-23T03:50:44	From an expert. Makes sense on a surface level but seems to allow for no introspection, but I guess none is needed? 
michaelianblack	723719918466818048	2016-04-23T03:47:29	So people in hell are suffering forever and don't even understand what they did to deserve it?  
michaelianblack	723719697917743104	2016-04-23T03:46:36	So the idea of being reunited with loved ones in heaven isn't true? I'm not being snarky - honestly trying to get it 
michaelianblack	723718887032918016	2016-04-23T03:43:23	ellen5e I'm trying to understand how one can be happy in a place of eternal happiness knowing loved ones are suffering in hell.
michaelianblack	723718595683987456	2016-04-23T03:42:13	Pretty sure that's the classic, religious definition.  
michaelianblack	723717769078956032	2016-04-23T03:38:56	wadeblack Converting.
michaelianblack	723717679975112705	2016-04-23T03:38:35	But if we lose "original knowledge" then we lose ourselves; therefore who is being rewarded with heaven? 
michaelianblack	723717413116743680	2016-04-23T03:37:31	PatrickRothfuss Lin_Manuel So thrilled I've never had the kind of success that necessitates signing so many books. blessed
michaelianblack	723717117237956608	2016-04-23T03:36:21	Is it not? Is there sorrow in heaven? I freely admit an incomplete understanding of the concept.  
michaelianblack	723716829252870144	2016-04-23T03:35:12	So, I loved you but you didn't love God, therefore I'm glad you're suffering for eternity? Seems kind of poopy. 
michaelianblack	723716452403056641	2016-04-23T03:33:42	Seems like we are reunited with loved ones in heaven, so if they're not there... Oops.  
michaelianblack	723716085669834752	2016-04-23T03:32:15	Is that the answer? The religious rejoice at the suffering of others (non-believers, for example) they loved?  
michaelianblack	723715447070318592	2016-04-23T03:29:43	Sincere theological question: how could somebody be happy in heaven (place of perfect happiness) knowing loved ones are in hell?

michaelianblack	723705340932534273	2016-04-23T02:49:33	socalmike_SD I think the Tubman decision is more of an affirmation of the overlooked than condemnation of Jackson, 'tho that's some of it.

michaelianblack	722352390100295680	2016-04-19T09:13:25	FreakPowerTix nonemoorblack Yeah, people were more excited about Obama in '08 than Bernie now.

michaelianblack	722350764824236032	2016-04-19T09:06:57	Zz1pp We're not arguing here. I like Bernie.
michaelianblack	722350558749728768	2016-04-19T09:06:08	trish_walsh U wish, slut.
michaelianblack	722350371922792448	2016-04-19T09:05:23	Zz1pp Agree. Judgement is absolutely key. Bernie's certainly been right about a lot of things. They both have. And wrong.
michaelianblack	722349145575391232	2016-04-19T09:00:31	Zz1pp And did their best in that moment. Truman was certainly not particularly accomplished. Nor Lincoln...
michaelianblack	722349030299185153	2016-04-19T09:00:04	Zz1pp I think it's more like all of our most successful presidents were shoved into circumstances for which they were not prepared...
michaelianblack	722348565092179968	2016-04-19T08:58:13	FreakPowerTix I think any senator, including Bernie, by definition, is a leader. And certainly a Secretary of State is the same.

michaelianblack	722345866049167360	2016-04-19T08:47:29	johnroderick Yeah, I've been to better parties.
michaelianblack	722345530462904320	2016-04-19T08:46:09	ZacFellows1 Zz1pp You might be right. I don't know. Which is why I started off by saying "I don't know."
michaelianblack	722345440939651072	2016-04-19T08:45:48	Love it. I love all that shit. Can he scale up? That's the question everybody's trying to answer for themselves.  
michaelianblack	722344830471245824	2016-04-19T08:43:22	LynsieLee howdoieventweet Agree. I think everybody's willing to sacrifice to move the country ahead. (Well, most people)
michaelianblack	722344592431919104	2016-04-19T08:42:26	QuixoticMcGee I think she's been very careful about not getting pushed too far with an eye on the general. She's smart.
michaelianblack	722344382775431169	2016-04-19T08:41:36	ZacFellows1 Zz1pp I understand but I don't know how that ripples out to the global economy for good or ill. I have no idea.
michaelianblack	722344123722694660	2016-04-19T08:40:34	I just think this argument is too facile. Trump is making the same one. Are you going to vote for him?  
michaelianblack	722343779772997632	2016-04-19T08:39:12	Bernie has been the anchor dragging from her comfortable positions. Been great for the Dem. party.  
michaelianblack	722343540613722112	2016-04-19T08:38:15	ZacFellows1 Zz1pp Wouldn't have the foggiest idea how to answer this intelligently.
michaelianblack	722343324527362048	2016-04-19T08:37:23	LynsieLee howdoieventweet It's a question of tactics. Which do you prefer? Which do you think has the best chance to move us ahead?
michaelianblack	722343221808881664	2016-04-19T08:36:59	LynsieLee howdoieventweet He IS honest. Hillary knows she can knife fight her way through the congress she has.
michaelianblack	722343074265849856	2016-04-19T08:36:24	Yeah, I think that's why he's connecting so strongly. The question is: how do you turn that into policy?  
michaelianblack	722342900302880768	2016-04-19T08:35:42	Zz1pp I hope you're right. I'm rooting for the movement.
michaelianblack	722342573977632768	2016-04-19T08:34:24	LynsieLee howdoieventweet But he's the first guy to say he can't do anything UNLESS he has the house and senate.
michaelianblack	722342317546311681	2016-04-19T08:33:23	It's also: if you've given up on trying to sleep.  
michaelianblack	722342184742100992	2016-04-19T08:32:51	CATHDISCBTON Sounds good. Except you can't improve on Wham!
michaelianblack	722341722882056193	2016-04-19T08:31:01	Yep.  
michaelianblack	722341626144686081	2016-04-19T08:30:38	Any argument that starts with "Our side always..." is the same argument the other side is having about themselves.  
michaelianblack	722341068264513536	2016-04-19T08:28:25	Yeah - cause there's no such thing as a savior in politics. That's what the Bernie people need to understand.  
michaelianblack	722340795357892608	2016-04-19T08:27:20	johnroderick I guess.
michaelianblack	722340759299424256	2016-04-19T08:27:12	She's certainly campaigning with loftier promises than she can achieve. Nobody's accusing Hillary of not pandering.  
michaelianblack	722340460497211392	2016-04-19T08:26:00	JoshLiam84 FreakPowerTix Maybe; by all means, vote for Bernie. I have no problem with him getting his votes, Hill gettting hers.
michaelianblack	722340265315270656	2016-04-19T08:25:14	Bhess Me saying she's getting what's due to her doesn't mean "more than" what's due, either. 'Night to you, too.
michaelianblack	722339966013939712	2016-04-19T08:24:02	Totally agree. Which is why I'm thrilled with what Bernie has been doing.  
michaelianblack	722339383492214784	2016-04-19T08:21:44	KayrisGYoung Nope.
michaelianblack	722339274129977345	2016-04-19T08:21:18	FreakPowerTix JoshLiam84 Sure. But it's not there, and I doubt he's the guy to get us there. Elizabeth Warren, maybe.
michaelianblack	722339094878138368	2016-04-19T08:20:35	Totally agree she's been hawkish internationally, too much so for my tastes.  
michaelianblack	722338837439995904	2016-04-19T08:19:33	To achieve real movement on the progressive agenda.  
michaelianblack	722338766543650817	2016-04-19T08:19:17	Hillary is somebody who can guide a movement but doesn't have one behind her to guide. They both need the other... 
michaelianblack	722338570560626688	2016-04-19T08:18:30	Yeah, Bernie is leading a powerful, populist movement without real direction other than Bernie... 
michaelianblack	722338301005266944	2016-04-19T08:17:26	Bhess Hillary has gotten and will continue to get all what's due to her.
michaelianblack	722338096834957312	2016-04-19T08:16:37	Which candidate can get us there quicker? Do you swing for the fences or play small ball? It's a legit debate.  
michaelianblack	722337979218268160	2016-04-19T08:16:09	Hillary and Bernie supporters isn't about lack of urgency regarding progressive goals but a legit debate about... 
michaelianblack	722337835798278144	2016-04-19T08:15:35	Haven't declared my intentions about who I support... but I would argue that the difference between...  
michaelianblack	722337316551823360	2016-04-19T08:13:31	Mr_Gentoo This is just a dumb argument. Progress means taking gains inch by inch. Sometimes you get more, but you still fight for inches.
michaelianblack	722337112532516865	2016-04-19T08:12:42	Agree. And we've seen a huge national movement towards raising minimum wage - started by neither Bernie nor Hillary. 
michaelianblack	722336853844578304	2016-04-19T08:11:40	FreakPowerTix I take your point, and agree. Which is why I have no problem with anybody supporting Bernie in the end...
michaelianblack	722336526000992256	2016-04-19T08:10:22	FreakPowerTix I imagine this is what she wants us to think of as her accomplishments: 
michaelianblack	722336092708417536	2016-04-19T08:08:39	FreakPowerTix No question, the Clintons have sold out for $$$.
michaelianblack	722335915197108224	2016-04-19T08:07:57	But when it's largest economy on earth, incrementalism is about the best you're going to get and probably smartest.  
michaelianblack	722335797429448704	2016-04-19T08:07:29	Question is: when it comes time to actually get shit done, which will prevail? On a school board, maybe big changes? 
michaelianblack	722335538095661056	2016-04-19T08:06:27	I definitely agree it's hard to root for incrementalism when radical change is what's promised... 
michaelianblack	722334953598353408	2016-04-19T08:04:07	FreakPowerTix Loved Jerry Brown in '92 for the same reasons I love Bernie now.
michaelianblack	722334575829987328	2016-04-19T08:02:37	FreakPowerTix I think the argument is valid. The transition from protest leader to leader is one not too many have successfully undergone.
michaelianblack	722334340374351872	2016-04-19T08:01:41	FreakPowerTix For all his lefty talk, which I imagine most progressives agree with, he has no record of implementing anything.
michaelianblack	722334205854625792	2016-04-19T08:01:09	FreakPowerTix I'm not parsing the article bit by bit, nor will the majority of its readers. The larger point, I think, was apt:
michaelianblack	722333360916303873	2016-04-19T07:57:48	Bhess She SAYS her intent. She was leaning Hillary already. Then she launches her fusillade against Bernie.
michaelianblack	722332759117553664	2016-04-19T07:55:24	Bhess Yeah, it's a hit piece on Bernie. She says so right at the beginning.
michaelianblack	722331453908844544	2016-04-19T07:50:13	root_of_all_eli No, I think it's honestly a brutal article.
michaelianblack	722329515288952832	2016-04-19T07:42:31	I'm not saying I agree with the conclusions in the article or not but the argument is brutal.

michaelianblack	720434813216387072	2016-04-14T02:13:39	0ryuge Ok. I got your point.
michaelianblack	720433452785537025	2016-04-14T02:08:14	0ryuge What you really want is for him to share your politics.
michaelianblack	720433158051729408	2016-04-14T02:07:04	0ryuge Again, you just don't like the fights he fights. That's fine, but no need to question his character b/c you disagree w/ his politics
michaelianblack	720432916631830528	2016-04-14T02:06:06	How would playing poor Egypt but boycotting rich Israel pad their bottom lines? And who boycotted Israel?  
michaelianblack	720432561256800256	2016-04-14T02:04:42	0ryuge I think your point was that he doesn't take brave stands. Incurring wrath of cops is brave.
michaelianblack	720431737273192449	2016-04-14T02:01:25	0ryuge Interesting article about Springsteen speaking out, incurring wrath of cops.  
michaelianblack	720430789540900866	2016-04-14T01:57:39	0ryuge I don't think you're in any position to determine how brave or not brave he is just because he's not fighting your fight.
michaelianblack	720430338682535936	2016-04-14T01:55:52	0ryuge Okay.
michaelianblack	720429686434721795	2016-04-14T01:53:16	0ryuge That differ with your opinions, but still might be a valid form of self-expression.
michaelianblack	720429550597869569	2016-04-14T01:52:44	0ryuge Spring. only gets involved to please his "rich friends"- as opposed to the argument that people can make principled decisions...
michaelianblack	720428690799206400	2016-04-14T01:49:19	0ryuge But Springsteen has fought for serious issues his entire career, so your argument is also a straw man.
michaelianblack	720428164544012288	2016-04-14T01:47:13	0ryuge As a conservative, why do you have a problem with somebody taking their business elsewhere?
michaelianblack	720427160146735104	2016-04-14T01:43:14	0ryuge Okay, but he's got a long history of political stands/statements/advocacy.
michaelianblack	720426664593899520	2016-04-14T01:41:16	0ryuge Why impugn his motives?
michaelianblack	720426615897915394	2016-04-14T01:41:04	0ryuge The other explanation is the one he stated: he opposes discrimination.
michaelianblack	720426101751721984	2016-04-14T01:39:02	0ryuge MottdeWitt How does canceling a show in NC benefit Bruce Springsteen? He doesn't need to shore up his lib cred.
michaelianblack	720425797400420354	2016-04-14T01:37:49	0ryuge Yes, I think civil rights require constant attention. See: voting rights act.

michaelianblack	720423003322867712	2016-04-14T01:26:43	buffalonichols Exactly. The argument is "We're not throwing people off buildings! We're just saying they can be fired for being gay."
michaelianblack	720422850213978113	2016-04-14T01:26:06	ddowza Not sure I agree with this or not - what's better? Have Egypt dependent on us or Russia/China?
michaelianblack	720422367495720960	2016-04-14T01:24:11	jpcintheop Generally, I think the motive is to belittle and demean, but as I said, I think the argument has some validity.
michaelianblack	720422151921078272	2016-04-14T01:23:20	0ryuge But to say that their concerns are invalid because other places are worse does nothing to affect positive change, either.
michaelianblack	720422026008080387	2016-04-14T01:22:50	0ryuge Worth fighting or not. If people want to challenge legislation, they have every right. I happen to agree with them on this one.
michaelianblack	720421889877811200	2016-04-14T01:22:17	0ryuge  When bad legislation is passed, it's incumbent on people to speak out and force change. Not really up to you to decide if it's...
michaelianblack	720421713691803648	2016-04-14T01:21:35	0ryuge Saying, "It won't affect too many people" isn't a good argument because that's how rights get chipped away - piecemeal.
michaelianblack	720421594019958784	2016-04-14T01:21:07	0ryuge  I think people feel like they understand how to fight locally, not globally, which I also think is fair.
michaelianblack	720421486486421504	2016-04-14T01:20:41	0ryuge gigilovestheo You're right that this battle won't affect Middle East, but it will affect attitudes and real lives at home.
michaelianblack	720420170762588161	2016-04-14T01:15:28	0ryuge gigilovestheo Yes, but that doesn't mean fighting smaller battles isn't important in the larger war.
michaelianblack	720420009818783744	2016-04-14T01:14:49	0ryuge The law in NC is discriminatory and should be fought. Nothing wrong with using appropriate means to fight it.
michaelianblack	720419761507553280	2016-04-14T01:13:50	0ryuge Of course it's silly compared to theocratic laws in Mid. East, Africa, but still discriminatory and we fight the fights we can win.
michaelianblack	720419419990544387	2016-04-14T01:12:29	0ryuge gigilovestheo Opposite, I think, is true. Nations can stand the heat better (N. Korea, Iran, etc.) N. Carolina can't stand heat.
michaelianblack	720419091039653888	2016-04-14T01:11:10	0ryuge You're faulting somebody for taking a principled stand against a discriminatory law b/c they didn't also do it in Middle East?
michaelianblack	720418190270996480	2016-04-14T01:07:35	I think I'm a bitch.

michaelianblack	720416817701761026	2016-04-14T01:02:08	But in the Middle East, it seems like the question is; is it better to isolate or reach out? Arguments for both... 
michaelianblack	720416702408732674	2016-04-14T01:01:41	Here in the US, can affect change in a number of ways including boycotting, corporate pressure, public pressure... 
michaelianblack	720416504395632640	2016-04-14T01:00:53	The way I see it, the question comes down to how can you best affect change for the better? Not black or white...  
michaelianblack	720416349046964224	2016-04-14T01:00:16	Keep seeing this argument, and although I think the motive behind it is suspect, I think it has some validity...

michaelianblack	720271574016741376	2016-04-13T15:24:59	colonelward Yes and yes.
michaelianblack	720271538822340609	2016-04-13T15:24:51	Here is the "if I serve gay people, it's slavery" argument.  YES! If a Muslim works in a restaurant that serves pork 
michaelianblack	720271177504063489	2016-04-13T15:23:25	simon0596 How do you know one of the Christians at that Bible study group isn't questioning their faith and decides they no longer believe?
michaelianblack	720271047207952385	2016-04-13T15:22:54	simon0596 A store cannot issue religious tests to its clientele, which is what you are asking them to do.
michaelianblack	720270921643130880	2016-04-13T15:22:24	simon0596 Why? Atheists can study the Bible. I study the Bible sometimes, and I'm an atheist.
michaelianblack	720270832472227841	2016-04-13T15:22:03	simon0596 If a Jewish group wanted to celebrate Ramadan in the tea room, I think they would be allowed to do so.
michaelianblack	720270745683623936	2016-04-13T15:21:42	simon0596 Obviously not, because there is no comparable Muslim religious ceremony being held in the tea room.
michaelianblack	720270607661735936	2016-04-13T15:21:09	simon0596 Provided the group's aren't disruptive, I see no reason why the bookstore shouldn't make this accommodation.
michaelianblack	720270526887755776	2016-04-13T15:20:50	simon0596 To study the Bible. I could see a Muslim group wanting to do Bible study there, or a Jewish group.
michaelianblack	720270463667077121	2016-04-13T15:20:35	simon0596 Bible study is bible study. If a Christian bookstore offers bible study, it seems to me they have to welcome anybody who wants...
michaelianblack	720270271970566144	2016-04-13T15:19:49	simon0596 Provided they are doing so in a respectful manner.
michaelianblack	720270066420305920	2016-04-13T15:19:00	simon0596 That's interesting - my instinct says if the atheists are studying the bible, the store should have to accommodate them...
michaelianblack	720268450120093697	2016-04-13T15:12:35	simon0596 You're making the argument, I think, that a Christian bookstore cannot "cross a line". Maybe I misunderstood what you meant.
michaelianblack	720268237741514752	2016-04-13T15:11:44	simon0596 So you're saying a Christian bookstore should have the right to ask for proof of religion before selling their wares?
michaelianblack	720267982509727745	2016-04-13T15:10:43	simon0596 A Christian bookstore can stock any titles they want, but cannot refuse to sell them to a Jew.
michaelianblack	720267789382987779	2016-04-13T15:09:57	SirChuckNorris7 simon0596 Hey - I see your arguments but cannot argue with two people simultaneously.
michaelianblack	720267604368097280	2016-04-13T15:09:13	simon0596 I would argue they should have to, provided the Satanists in question are actually a religion and not, for example, a hate group.
michaelianblack	720267465272348673	2016-04-13T15:08:40	simon0596 A better argument would be to ask if the dry cleaner should be allowed to refuse to clean the robes used in the Satanic mass.
michaelianblack	720267230060027904	2016-04-13T15:07:44	simon0596 But say, "We're still in business" when a Christian does.
michaelianblack	720267143913218048	2016-04-13T15:07:23	simon0596 They can't say "we're no longer in business" when a Muslim walks through the door...
michaelianblack	720267059779645440	2016-04-13T15:07:03	simon0596 If they go out of business, they are going out of business to everybody.
michaelianblack	720266991789998080	2016-04-13T15:06:47	simon0596 Any business is free to go out of business at any time. Have never argued otherwise. Equal accommodation.
michaelianblack	720266727276195840	2016-04-13T15:05:44	simon0596 Refuse the bible study group to hold their meetings there. They have to make equal accommodations.
michaelianblack	720266634686889984	2016-04-13T15:05:22	simon0596 And a Muslim group wants to study the Koran there. I would argue the coffee shop is obligated to allow them to do so OR
michaelianblack	720266515925176320	2016-04-13T15:04:53	simon0596 Because I'm not making that argument. HOWEVER - let's say there's a coffee shop that allows a Bible study group to meet there.
michaelianblack	720266402947436544	2016-04-13T15:04:27	simon0596 So, you think I'm arguing that a dry cleaner should be forced to allow a Satanic Mass in their business?
michaelianblack	720266098629681152	2016-04-13T15:03:14	simon0596 No. Nobody has ever argued that businesses are not free to close their doors.
michaelianblack	720265980740382720	2016-04-13T15:02:46	Maverick_SS_49 Can you please point to any example where I have "sucked up" to people in the Middle East?
michaelianblack	720265823181406208	2016-04-13T15:02:08	simon0596 Nobody is arguing they do: but they cannot discriminate based on race, gender, national origin, or skin color.
michaelianblack	720265394527690754	2016-04-13T15:00:26	simon0596 But should Chick-Fil-A have the ability to refuse service to gay customers? I would argue no. You seem to argue yes.
michaelianblack	720265103707213825	2016-04-13T14:59:17	simon0596 By "Black mass," do you mean a Satanic cult?
michaelianblack	720265029484806144	2016-04-13T14:58:59	simon0596 By acknowledging that there should be a law protecting Muslims, you have affirmed my argument. Now it's just a question of degree
michaelianblack	720262188896616448	2016-04-13T14:47:42	simon0596 You may wish for a libertarian utopia where all businesses act morally b/c it's in their best interest, but that's not real life.
michaelianblack	720261894339059712	2016-04-13T14:46:32	simon0596 Social opprobrium absolutely carries weight in some places, but that's not the same as a restaurant refusing service to Muslims.
michaelianblack	720261621675745281	2016-04-13T14:45:27	simon0596 From my point of view, I'm glad we have laws that protect people from discrimination.
michaelianblack	720261381123997696	2016-04-13T14:44:29	simon0596 Okay, well that's your point of view and it seems to be shared by many. But I'm guessing you've never faced discrimination.
michaelianblack	720260858748620801	2016-04-13T14:42:25	ditzkoff Chris and I thrilled to have this opportunity.
michaelianblack	720260215443054592	2016-04-13T14:39:51	simon0596 We only need to look back 50 years into our own history to see the need for these laws.
michaelianblack	720260012426207232	2016-04-13T14:39:03	simon0596 You could maybe argue that those classes should no longer be protected but I think you'd it'd be a steep climb.
michaelianblack	720259919291678720	2016-04-13T14:38:41	simon0596 That simply saying "Don't shop there" doesn't rectify. To remedy this, the government created "protected classes."
michaelianblack	720259824848515072	2016-04-13T14:38:18	simon0596 Have suffered exclusion based on skin color, race, national origin, and gender. This exclusion materially affects them in ways...
michaelianblack	720259654975008769	2016-04-13T14:37:38	simon0596 For a Springsteen concert, I don't know. For a store, because the 1964 Civil Rights Law recognizes that certain classes of people
michaelianblack	720259481590829058	2016-04-13T14:36:56	simon0596 At Trump rallies, his security routinely asks people to leave without reason. Seems to be legal.
michaelianblack	720259357397495808	2016-04-13T14:36:27	simon0596 Of course, because NAMBLA are not a protected class. But should I have the right to refuse if there are black people there?
michaelianblack	720258818454589445	2016-04-13T14:34:18	simon0596 But, again, I'm not a lawyer so I don't know the legal distinctions. That's just a guess on my part.
michaelianblack	720258602083037184	2016-04-13T14:33:27	simon0596 He can set the terms of the show - can he set the terms based on skin color or gender? I don't know.
michaelianblack	720258468381261824	2016-04-13T14:32:55	simon0596 I don't think this is legally true. For example, Springsteen can say "this show is open to eighteen years of age and older."
michaelianblack	720257062547124224	2016-04-13T14:27:20	sleepy_jeannie If a company is breaking the law, is it justifiable to seek justice? That is the issue - not the triviality of a cake.
michaelianblack	720256867549622273	2016-04-13T14:26:33	sleepy_jeannie Extrapolate outwards: is it justifiable to sue a company that does not provide you service based on skin color?
michaelianblack	720255743576768514	2016-04-13T14:22:05	colonelward How so?

michaelianblack	720233282177265664	2016-04-13T12:52:50	simon0596 Not a lawyer but my guess is that a concert is not the same as a store or place of business: it is a private event.

michaelianblack	719930305189122048	2016-04-12T16:48:55	If you are a baker, baking a cake is clearly not against your religion.  
michaelianblack	719930058832539649	2016-04-12T16:47:56	They would care because it would be against the law. Where are you seeing these hateful Muslim bakers?  
michaelianblack	719926322030604288	2016-04-12T16:33:05	A thing I wrote on Facebook about ThankGodForJokes.   
michaelianblack	719927286183686145	2016-04-12T16:36:55	"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."  Yeah, probably would've ended sooner if not for law. 
michaelianblack	719926614067384320	2016-04-12T16:34:15	That's what I thought. Thanks.  
michaelianblack	719926215075852288	2016-04-12T16:32:39	Which demos are we talking about? Still the KKK?  
michaelianblack	719925986293321728	2016-04-12T16:31:45	Not sure what the law is here. My understanding is that musicians' *request* their music not to be played. Anyone? 
michaelianblack	719925378773594113	2016-04-12T16:29:20	A business has the right to refuse service to an unruly drunk.   This makes sense.   Issue is legalized bigotry. 
michaelianblack	719924129613410304	2016-04-12T16:24:22	Would not have thought this possible, but yep.  
michaelianblack	719923933156392960	2016-04-12T16:23:35	Our culture has decided discrimination based on these attributes is wrong and deserves legal remedy. Hence 1964 Law 
michaelianblack	719923797432934400	2016-04-12T16:23:03	Re: KKK.   The reason THESE are protected classes is b/c they have historically been subject to discrimination. 1/2 
michaelianblack	719923462970687489	2016-04-12T16:21:43	therobertmorris Not sure he would be capable.
michaelianblack	719923351939084291	2016-04-12T16:21:17	Not on fed. level. Arguments now are about discriminatory state laws which will eventually be ruled unconstitutional 
michaelianblack	719922990645972992	2016-04-12T16:19:51	ermccurr robdelaney Either way.
michaelianblack	719922853332787200	2016-04-12T16:19:18	KKK is not a protected class. Neither a race, nor a religion, nor a gender, nor a national origin.  
michaelianblack	719921861702901760	2016-04-12T16:15:21	So your argument is the South *wanted* integration were it not for those pesky Jim Crow laws?  
michaelianblack	719920204407533568	2016-04-12T16:08:46	sleepydad RyanTate88 Became illegal in 1964.
michaelianblack	719919578151825408	2016-04-12T16:06:17	Holy shit, the ignorance:  See: The South 1865-1964 
michaelianblack	719918556423524352	2016-04-12T16:02:13	Not a prob. for me b/c of my washboard abs.   But for others, people w/o shirts do not constitute a protected class. 
michaelianblack	719916988856954880	2016-04-12T15:56:00	Anything you don't want to do is slavery.  
michaelianblack	719916755884380160	2016-04-12T15:55:04	joshgroban Scott is standing in you AND the rest of the cast AND the crew?!??? Wow.
michaelianblack	719916154085629952	2016-04-12T15:52:41	trevogre Nope. Neither thoughtful nor engaging.
michaelianblack	719916056802955265	2016-04-12T15:52:17	Voila. Different guy.   Voluntary employment at a place of business can NEVER be slavery.  
michaelianblack	719915838577487873	2016-04-12T15:51:25	trevogre Ok - you've made your point. I hear you, I think you're ignorant of both history and the law, and I'm done.
michaelianblack	719915563217260545	2016-04-12T15:50:20	Currently arguing with a guy who believes a business legally being obligated to serve people he doesn't want to serve is the same as slavery
michaelianblack	719914952274939906	2016-04-12T15:47:54	trevogre This was LITERALLY the case in this country for centuries.
michaelianblack	719914696946618368	2016-04-12T15:46:53	trevogre I cannot refuse to work with a black director because he's black, although I imagine that would be very hard to prove in court.
michaelianblack	719914497285218305	2016-04-12T15:46:06	trevogre As I said before, if you allow that, you end up with a block of business refusing service to, for example, black people.
michaelianblack	719914270968963073	2016-04-12T15:45:12	trevogre Except that would be against the law if your reasons were based on race, gender, religion, etc.
michaelianblack	719914125074243586	2016-04-12T15:44:37	trevogre Rights enshrined by law. As a matter of law, I have a right to service in a place of business.
michaelianblack	719913089731313665	2016-04-12T15:40:30	trevogre You're right, to a point. The problem is this thinking leads to discrimination, which then interferes w/ my rights.
michaelianblack	719912767797465088	2016-04-12T15:39:13	trevogre From Legal Zoom. 
michaelianblack	719912426632822786	2016-04-12T15:37:52	trevogre If that's the case, do you support Jim Crow era which allowed discrimination based solely on race?
michaelianblack	719912210835836928	2016-04-12T15:37:01	trevogre Should not be made to serve anybody they do not want to serve?
michaelianblack	719912158570618880	2016-04-12T15:36:48	trevogre Okay, so let's go back and see if we can find common ground. Your argument is that an employee (or owner) of a biz...
michaelianblack	719911549079576576	2016-04-12T15:34:23	trevogre Are you arguing that being forced to serve all people in a store is tantamount to slavery?
michaelianblack	719911426006073344	2016-04-12T15:33:53	trevogre Wait - let's go back because I think we might be making two different arguments.
michaelianblack	719911240139677696	2016-04-12T15:33:09	chrisgeidner dominicholden And please keep in mind, my understanding of the law is at a "People's Court" level.
michaelianblack	719910782281060352	2016-04-12T15:31:20	trevogre adamwilliams84 Is this a joke? Are you trolling me? Because if not, this is literally Jim Crow shit you're endorsing.
michaelianblack	719910457113452545	2016-04-12T15:30:02	chrisgeidner dominicholden Agreed, and would have said as much in a longer form format.
michaelianblack	719909428179443712	2016-04-12T15:25:57	TomWhighamEsq Didn't see that, but it's hilarious.
michaelianblack	719909167889313792	2016-04-12T15:24:55	colbyhall TomWhighamEsq I was *born* available!!!
michaelianblack	719908716984868865	2016-04-12T15:23:08	Agreed. That's why I say the two are interrelated but not necessarily correlated.  
michaelianblack	719908584205717509	2016-04-12T15:22:36	notmargot663 The history is long. Would be interesting to read about origins. I have no idea.
michaelianblack	719908298892386304	2016-04-12T15:21:28	As a *not* attorney, I don't understand this sentence. 
michaelianblack	719907987859619842	2016-04-12T15:20:14	I know, but the trans laws only popped up after gay marriage declared constitutional. The two are interrelated.  
michaelianblack	719907434219905024	2016-04-12T15:18:02	No, but there's been a sudden influx of gay people getting overdue protection under the law. Coincidence?  
michaelianblack	719907132074815488	2016-04-12T15:16:50	Agreed. Have your beliefs. But you cannot impose your beliefs on others as a precondition of operating a public biz. 
michaelianblack	719906668197359616	2016-04-12T15:14:59	trevogre adamwilliams84 Accommodate the entire public. Cannot just serve one class of people and not another.
michaelianblack	719906583321387008	2016-04-12T15:14:39	trevogre adamwilliams84 Not sure what the law says about this, but my understanding is, if you are open *to* the public, you have to...
michaelianblack	719906224976826368	2016-04-12T15:13:13	KathleenBYoung Thank YOU for listening!
michaelianblack	719874394001141762	2016-04-12T13:06:44	iamseemo To me, they should be able to refuse but I can't justify it legally using my own argument.
michaelianblack	719874279622471681	2016-04-12T13:06:17	iamseemo I agree with this and think it's applicable. Is a baker allowed to refuse to make a "Happy birthday Hitler" cake?
michaelianblack	719867687640428545	2016-04-12T12:40:05	ianslessor socksnsandal Wait, you think mental health care is "affirmation and praise"?

michaelianblack	719863827064561664	2016-04-12T12:24:45	ianslessor By the way, I am stealing this argument from others. Not original, but applicable.
michaelianblack	719863673645318145	2016-04-12T12:24:08	ianslessor The Bible explicitly states "spare the rod, spoil the child."
michaelianblack	719863602048606208	2016-04-12T12:23:51	ianslessor Foster parents cannot be prosecuted for the manner in which they raise their children if it's according to religious beliefs.
michaelianblack	719863449505947649	2016-04-12T12:23:15	ianslessor Oh oh - I refer you to Mississippi's new law which allows just that.
michaelianblack	719863355373129728	2016-04-12T12:22:52	ianslessor What are you talking about?
michaelianblack	719863231997722624	2016-04-12T12:22:23	sepinwall You're winning me over.
michaelianblack	719862136340680704	2016-04-12T12:18:02	ianslessor So you want people who are men in every respect except they are born women, using the women's room?
michaelianblack	719861857264234497	2016-04-12T12:16:55	ianslessor The one that says foster parents are immune from prosecution if they beat their kids so long if done according to rel. belfs?
michaelianblack	719861282682355712	2016-04-12T12:14:38	ianslessor The one that says mental health therapists can turn away patients they don't agree with?
michaelianblack	719861167557095425	2016-04-12T12:14:11	ianslessor The one that says local ordinances cannot pass anti-discrimination laws?
michaelianblack	719861010153279488	2016-04-12T12:13:33	ianslessor Which law are you referring to specifically? The one that says transgendered people can't use public bathroom of choice?

michaelianblack	712001258043875328	2016-03-21T19:41:42	Andrewc11776 Of course it's possible, but consider that Trump's are the only rallies where this happens.

michaelianblack	707773842035511297	2016-03-10T03:43:28	Univision just showed a clip of Sanders defending Fidel Castro in 1985, proving that he has been consistent for thirty years in looking old.
michaelianblack	707773270658060288	2016-03-10T03:41:12	Clinton: The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights upheld, which is why when I am president, Gloria Estefan will be their queen.

michaelianblack	707766180338073600	2016-03-10T03:13:01	Sanders: I don't take money from banks or pharmaceuticals or fossil fuels. That is why I am wearing such a shitty suit.

michaelianblack	707045901114671105	2016-03-08T03:30:53	I used the term "conservative" very deliberately instead of "Republican," and clarified that I meant its current use 
michaelianblack	707045209205510145	2016-03-08T03:28:08	pctreadway Ok.
michaelianblack	707045076153864192	2016-03-08T03:27:37	pctreadway True. Because most of the Republican platform infuriates me.
michaelianblack	707044166413524994	2016-03-08T03:24:00	pctreadway But obviously we can start with the Emancipation Proclamation and go from there. 15th Amend, Social Security, Voting Acts...

michaelianblack	707042736445100032	2016-03-08T03:18:19	pctreadway Ok, cool.
michaelianblack	707042625644269569	2016-03-08T03:17:52	pctreadway Probably not - I wasn't talking about libertarianism at all. You brought it up.
michaelianblack	707042202288054272	2016-03-08T03:16:11	pctreadway I'm talking about the current breed of insurrectionists taking over the current election cycle.
michaelianblack	707042100257366017	2016-03-08T03:15:47	pctreadway Of course I'm talking about Trump and Cruz. And Rubio (although he believes whatever he's told).
michaelianblack	707041913724133377	2016-03-08T03:15:03	pctreadway I think libertarianism has become a catchall term for (primarily) right-wingers who feel like conservatives don't go far enough.
michaelianblack	707041162272575488	2016-03-08T03:12:03	pctreadway What serious policies do anything of them to have reduce gov't, except Cruz's "eliminate the IRS", which is nonsense.
michaelianblack	707041014469541888	2016-03-08T03:11:28	pctreadway Expanding the military, building a giant fucking wall, preventing people from marrying, making sure guns are always available...
michaelianblack	707040810135658497	2016-03-08T03:10:39	pctreadway Reducing gov't is not what current conservatism is about. It is about forceable deportation; would require massive gov't...
michaelianblack	707040161062916096	2016-03-08T03:08:05	pctreadway Of course, yes. State laws, although I think Redlining actually came from Federal law.

michaelianblack	707039300106514432	2016-03-08T03:04:39	pctreadway writer_nw But I will say that Jews and blacks share a long history of fighting for civil rights for obvious reasons.

michaelianblack	707038824325632002	2016-03-08T03:02:46	pctreadway writer_nw You can't separate slavery from the rest of the black experience. Everything flows from there.
michaelianblack	707038739659427840	2016-03-08T03:02:26	richholton ToddHannant The idea of "white protecting their rights" IS this nation's history.

michaelianblack	707037369426427904	2016-03-08T02:56:59	pctreadway writer_nw overview:   
michaelianblack	707036722157240320	2016-03-08T02:54:25	JdKirkpatrick Rings a bell - what's the source?
michaelianblack	707036631161765889	2016-03-08T02:54:03	Take it up with the Constitution.  
michaelianblack	707036552111771649	2016-03-08T02:53:44	Tell me what I'm missing about conservatism right now that isn't primarily a function of protecting white people.  
michaelianblack	707035915315761152	2016-03-08T02:51:12	But Movement Conservatives are using that label to hijack the Republican Party; the only commonality is whiteness.  
michaelianblack	707035277517312000	2016-03-08T02:48:40	I would also argue for the freedom to use hate speech. (Almost) all speech should be protected.  
michaelianblack	707034948830666752	2016-03-08T02:47:22	JdKirkpatrick Don't know this story.
michaelianblack	707034878362198016	2016-03-08T02:47:05	I have no problem with this, but were you advocating this position before gay people wanted to marry?  
michaelianblack	707034634186584064	2016-03-08T02:46:07	I think this could be a problem, but isn't political policy driven by elected officials.  
michaelianblack	707034199581138945	2016-03-08T02:44:23	I agree most conservatives are reasonable. I love my conservative friends, but I loathe what the term means now. 
michaelianblack	707033976863645696	2016-03-08T02:43:30	How do liberals limit free speech?  
michaelianblack	707033130406973440	2016-03-08T02:40:08	Is open carrying an assault weapon a basic human right? What about the right to live in a sustainable climate?  
michaelianblack	707032997418168323	2016-03-08T02:39:37	Do basic human rights include dignity for all people? The right to vote? Marry the partner of your choice?  
michaelianblack	707032510773993476	2016-03-08T02:37:41	Yes it is.  
michaelianblack	707032454545195008	2016-03-08T02:37:27	I don't think Trump is Hitler. Trump is just a baby fascist. Has to crawl before he runs. Given enough time, though? 
michaelianblack	707032035563610112	2016-03-08T02:35:47	And yet conservatism, as practiced in this moment, is primarily about protecting a vanishing white status quo.  
michaelianblack	707030831605411840	2016-03-08T02:31:00	Perfect. Refers to black people who share his ideology as "mascots".  
michaelianblack	707030276371828736	2016-03-08T02:28:48	The fact that you can name most of the prominent black conservatives in a single tweet kind of proves my point.  
michaelianblack	707029626246307840	2016-03-08T02:26:13	SarahThyre Maybe, but I agree with that part.
michaelianblack	707028979753033728	2016-03-08T02:23:39	Having a hard time understanding what "conservative" means in the political context anymore other than "white".

michaelianblack	706606205871980544	2016-03-06T22:23:42	MLG0298 To clarify, what is your main issue with undocumented immigrants? And what is your biggest issue determining your vote for Trump?
michaelianblack	706605882872897536	2016-03-06T22:22:25	MLG0298 I've already given you the stats on Trump's tax proposals. Here's more:  
michaelianblack	706600716857643008	2016-03-06T22:01:53	MLG0298 You still have not answered how you can square Trump's tax policies with your concerns about the debt.
michaelianblack	706600643767767040	2016-03-06T22:01:36	MLG0298 If your main goal is to reduce the debt, surely you can't support a candidate who promises to increase it by trillions.
michaelianblack	706600549924343808	2016-03-06T22:01:13	MLG0298 It seems like your main argument against undocumented immigrants is that they add to the national debt:  
michaelianblack	706599799827648512	2016-03-06T21:58:14	MLG0298 Perhaps, but if Mexico had spent decades tacitly encouraging Americans to emigrate and then decided to kick out millions, then no.
michaelianblack	706599026674819072	2016-03-06T21:55:10	paulandstorm BadAstronomer Perhaps not. Samoas have been advocating for protected status for years to no avail.
michaelianblack	706598809372139521	2016-03-06T21:54:18	MLG0298 A reasonable point, but I'm still having trouble understanding your desire to forcibly deport 11M people through a Christian lens.

michaelianblack	706596610457919488	2016-03-06T21:45:34	BadAstronomer I thought that Marbury v. Dunkin rendered that decision moot.
michaelianblack	706596460721278978	2016-03-06T21:44:58	MLG0298 I'm trying to understand how you reconcile all of these contradictions.
michaelianblack	706596400625270785	2016-03-06T21:44:44	MLG0298 You identify yourself as a follower of Christ, yet you support the most unchristian way to deal with immigrants.
michaelianblack	706596182798311427	2016-03-06T21:43:52	MLG0298 You say the national debt means we can't afford to help immigrants, yet Trump's policies will increase the debt.
michaelianblack	706596068809711616	2016-03-06T21:43:25	MLG0298 You claim immigrants make it hard to provide for your family, yet as you say, you provide for other families.
michaelianblack	706595968318349312	2016-03-06T21:43:01	MLG0298 I don't doubt that you do, but your logic seems inconsistent.

michaelianblack	706594225710882816	2016-03-06T21:36:05	MLG0298 Would seem then that, as a Christian, you are forsaking nothing to help the destitute and poor as Jesus commanded, no?
michaelianblack	706594078239096836	2016-03-06T21:35:30	MLG0298 Immigration has not impacted your family, so the analogy of not giving to the poor/needy b/c your family comes first doesn't hold.
michaelianblack	706593843911790592	2016-03-06T21:34:34	SaraJBenincasa Me too, but thought it was weird when Picard died from AIDS on Next Gen.

michaelianblack	706592854068629504	2016-03-06T21:30:38	MLG0298 Help me understand then. Is your biggest concern for this country our debt? Trump's tax policies will radically INCREASE the debt.

michaelianblack	706592354728341504	2016-03-06T21:28:39	SaraJBenincasa Yeah, both - but I think it had more to do with just getting a handle on what the disease actually IS.
michaelianblack	706592075320528897	2016-03-06T21:27:33	SaraJBenincasa But I could be wrong and didn't look it up because I wanted to show off my AIDS knowledge.

michaelianblack	706558273609146369	2016-03-06T19:13:14	MLG0298 I'm not a Christian, but my understanding is that Jesus advocated sharing with the destitute, the poor, the needy. Am I wrong?
michaelianblack	706526588649738240	2016-03-06T17:07:20	MLG0298 Agreed. And what about the immigration question? How do you square love/mercy with forceable expulsion?

michaelianblack	706522483910959104	2016-03-06T16:51:01	MLG0298 What about the immigration question? And does it trouble you that Trump has been caught in so many lies? How do you believe him?
michaelianblack	706516790709526528	2016-03-06T16:28:24	MLG0298 Also, his immigration policies (forceable deportation) seem unchristian to me, as they are without love or mercy.
michaelianblack	706516513440866304	2016-03-06T16:27:17	MLG0298 That makes sense, but Trump's words/deeds seem so unchristian, it seems like making a deal with the devil to me.

michaelianblack	705432034135711745	2016-03-03T16:37:57	Watch Romney tear apart Trump live here:   
michaelianblack	705430817766547456	2016-03-03T16:33:07	And yet, the more I think about it, the more I think the idea might have some merit.  
michaelianblack	705430698941947904	2016-03-03T16:32:39	Somebody once had the crazy idea that politicians serve like jurors. You're called, you go. Seemed insane to me... 
michaelianblack	705430450962100229	2016-03-03T16:31:40	Never.   No reason to subject myself to (even more) personal attacks, endless fund raising, and ribbon cuttings.

michaelianblack	705429008897482752	2016-03-03T16:25:56	I have some other suggestions to make people feel more invested in their country...  
michaelianblack	705428951146110976	2016-03-03T16:25:42	Best way to make people feel invested is to ask them to pay more in taxes than they already do?  
michaelianblack	705428175388581889	2016-03-03T16:22:37	There are already so many barriers for the poor to overcome, not sure how jacking up their taxes is going to help.  
michaelianblack	705428029066121217	2016-03-03T16:22:03	Towards people who know far more about what's best for themselves than you. In effect, you are punishing poverty.  
michaelianblack	705427911998885889	2016-03-03T16:21:35	For people already paying through the nose as a proportion of their income, you take a highly paternalistic attitude 
michaelianblack	705427795422396416	2016-03-03T16:21:07	Moreover, they are already paying taxes. Payroll taxes, SS taxes, sales taxes. When you advocate higher taxes...  
michaelianblack	705427600156594177	2016-03-03T16:20:20	I understand the analogy, but suspect poor people are concerned about weightier issues than data charges...  
michaelianblack	705426796020436992	2016-03-03T16:17:09	Confident poor ppl would argue tax spending is already unfair w/o the additional motivation of paying more in taxes. 
michaelianblack	705426255089438720	2016-03-03T16:15:00	US military budget 2015: $610B.  Next largest is Russia, with a budget of $84.5B  Maybe we could shrink a *little*?  
michaelianblack	705425264222867457	2016-03-03T16:11:03	To rephrase your argument: the poor should pay more in taxes to encourage them to vote?  
michaelianblack	705424374971703296	2016-03-03T16:07:31	Agree. Although, to me, that basically means spending less on the military.  
michaelianblack	705422808407474176	2016-03-03T16:01:18	Personally, I'm okay with the poor paying little to no taxes BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR. Hence, progressive tax system.  
michaelianblack	705422021488934912	2016-03-03T15:58:10	ikevinax THEN YOU ARE A COMMUNIST AND MUST BE STOPPED!!!
michaelianblack	705421471858991105	2016-03-03T15:55:59	You could make that argument about, literally, everything related to the common good. That's why we have laws.  
michaelianblack	705420809091858432	2016-03-03T15:53:21	Ok. Seemed like common sense to me but if you want to get all fancy about it.  
michaelianblack	705420657073528833	2016-03-03T15:52:45	Seen so many people make this idiotic remark over the years. Obviously, it only works when we all pitch in together. 
michaelianblack	705420114619924480	2016-03-03T15:50:36	Example: paying slightly higher taxes would be worth it to me to benefit many. Paying all my $ in taxes would not be 
michaelianblack	705419848386531328	2016-03-03T15:49:32	Personally, I think you have to balance self-interest against greater good. One can go too far in both directions.

michaelianblack	705389522788474881	2016-03-03T13:49:02	Buffalo_Nickel Or do you mean not participating in the rhetoric?
michaelianblack	705389456329711620	2016-03-03T13:48:46	Buffalo_Nickel Let me understand- not participating equals dividing the government?
michaelianblack	705388734741680131	2016-03-03T13:45:54	Buffalo_Nickel And what do you mean specifically when you say "Divide the government"?
michaelianblack	705388662100520960	2016-03-03T13:45:37	Buffalo_Nickel Yeah, that didn't answer my question.

michaelianblack	704017868820717569	2016-02-28T18:58:34	An excellent question.  
michaelianblack	704017625559474177	2016-02-28T18:57:36	Why not just say, "I said it on Froday and I'll say it again: David Duke's beliefs have no place in my campaign"?

michaelianblack	704016915577049088	2016-02-28T18:54:47	And because he is so strongly associated with racism, bigotry, and misogyny, he needs to answer again and again.

michaelianblack	704015718413672450	2016-02-28T18:50:01	Like if I was asked if I disavowed David Duke's support, I would say yes every time. Not just on Fridays.  
michaelianblack	704015387483115520	2016-02-28T18:48:43	When asked again, he should say "I disavow" again not, "I have to research these people."

michaelianblack	702598947362246656	2016-02-24T21:00:17	amymiller On social media. On the other hand, I also don't like people being punished for exercising free speech. To me, that speech...
michaelianblack	702598630193172480	2016-02-24T20:59:01	amymiller Was truly as benign as they suggest, they would have included that info. Also, I am well aware how women are treated every day...
michaelianblack	702598512152854528	2016-02-24T20:58:33	amymiller Sure. To be clear, I'm not taking sides in this yet, but I am highly suspicious of Breitbart and suspect if whatever MD said...

michaelianblack	702244353603989504	2016-02-23T21:31:15	Therefore any president's nominations should end after off-year elections in which opposing party wins Congress?

michaelianblack	701314680158085120	2016-02-21T07:57:04	24RMH   8. There are already millions and millions of undocumented immigrants here. There is no viable way to expel them.
michaelianblack	701314500230778880	2016-02-21T07:56:21	24RMH   7. Unemployment among Americans is 5%, so clearly immigration is not causing many Americans to lose jobs.
michaelianblack	701314261071622144	2016-02-21T07:55:24	24RMH   6. Net illegal immigration is zero right now, at least across the Southern border.

michaelianblack	701313695918456836	2016-02-21T07:53:09	24RMH   4. I don't think immigrants come here expecting to be taken care of. They work tough jobs for low wages.
michaelianblack	701313445875085313	2016-02-21T07:52:09	24RMH   3. A border would not stop me if it meant my kids got to eat.
