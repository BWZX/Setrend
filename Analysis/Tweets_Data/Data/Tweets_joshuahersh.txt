joshuahersh	712282695997509632	2016-03-22T14:20:02	nolesfan2011 interesting, sounds right

joshuahersh	712281076304056321	2016-03-22T14:13:36	You need arrests (like Abdeslam) not shootouts that leave all witnesses dead (see: Verviers )
joshuahersh	712281008800980993	2016-03-22T14:13:20	You can’t “go to war” against this problem. You need diligent detective work, informants, community policing.

joshuahersh	712280464988479488	2016-03-22T14:11:11	They were radical—in the way that a street gang member might be radical—but not necessarily “radicalized.”
joshuahersh	712280406138159105	2016-03-22T14:10:57	But it was also clear that many (most) of them were not, in a traditional sense, terrorists: they weren’t religious, hadn’t gone to Syria.
