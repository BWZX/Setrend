JoshZumbrun	720371744452661248	2016-04-13T22:03:02	MarkCalabria no, analysis of the tax gap does not account for the "value of the privacy" as an offset to lost revenue.
JoshZumbrun	720370623990468608	2016-04-13T21:58:35	MarkCalabria I'm not sure that when it comes to, say, waiters reporting cash tips we should put heavy weight on the "privacy" aspect
JoshZumbrun	720368443397046278	2016-04-13T21:49:55	MarkCalabria hmm... when should we account for the value of "privacy" from the rule of law? Clearly that does have some value too.

JoshZumbrun	720327394574217216	2016-04-13T19:06:48	pujalords that's a great research topic too
JoshZumbrun	720326725830254593	2016-04-13T19:04:09	That's not to say that there's nothing you can do with their data, but you can't use it to gauge people who don't change jobs
JoshZumbrun	720326383109427203	2016-04-13T19:02:47	If you've never changed jobs and don't intend to, why would you even bother creating a LinkedIn profile?
JoshZumbrun	720326184777551874	2016-04-13T19:02:00	Might be late to pointing this out, but LinkedIn data is almost perfectly biased to NOT provide a good gauge of job-hopping

JoshZumbrun	720252885364178944	2016-04-13T14:10:44	BrianRKnight right, that's the problem with the whole framing. You can't say "I only care about jobs, not bubbles"

JoshZumbrun	720252266041593857	2016-04-13T14:08:16	Yeah, because the way the Fed ignored the housing bubble worked out *great* for the Midwest

JoshZumbrun	719888577203601410	2016-04-12T14:03:06	billygriffin22 yes, which is why I said, although it doesn't go back 50 years, this does show decline in recent decades.
JoshZumbrun	719888444399300608	2016-04-12T14:02:34	billygriffin22 I disagree, these are all reasonable ways that someone might think of the question "people like me"
JoshZumbrun	719886865759776769	2016-04-12T13:56:18	billygriffin22 that's true of a great deal of time-series data but it doesn't really negate the point here, imo

JoshZumbrun	699622238195204096	2016-02-16T15:51:54	VernMcKinley well, I dunno if that's fair because Minneapolis Fed does have a good history on this issue
JoshZumbrun	699620759539486721	2016-02-16T15:46:02	Interesting: Minneapolis Fed will develop a plan by the end of the year that it says will end Too Big To Fail

JoshZumbrun	698153623503642624	2016-02-12T14:36:09	riisacoff WSJ disagree; the last recession was so bad and widespread and recent that awareness remains sky high

JoshZumbrun	698117297731407872	2016-02-12T12:11:48	JoshZumbrun Actually since money catches fire and oil catches fire even better, I posit that oil is the truest money.
JoshZumbrun	698116301990965248	2016-02-12T12:07:51	Love this analysis but since gold is only true money (not pieces of paper from FED!!) the chart should be inverted

JoshZumbrun	697960390999683072	2016-02-12T01:48:19	GGcontre1 the other big question (that I don't know) is when does the debt mature... pretty big difference if it's 30-year vs shorter term.
JoshZumbrun	697959871686180864	2016-02-12T01:46:15	pragmatico100 but you're right that 0.5% rate + $3t in unreversed QE ought to be a lot different than an 0.5% rate but no QE
JoshZumbrun	697959349491073024	2016-02-12T01:44:11	pragmatico100 Fed is scared of selling assets (reverse QE) for two reasons 1) might disrupt market and 2) might incur losses
JoshZumbrun	697958926147416065	2016-02-12T01:42:30	pragmatico100 so you mean why is Fed raising rates but not reversing QE?
JoshZumbrun	697958715962437632	2016-02-12T01:41:39	GGcontre1 that's not exactly same categories (some public-owned savings bonds are non-marketable for example) but I bet it's in ballpark
JoshZumbrun	697958538304335873	2016-02-12T01:40:57	GGcontre1 Marketable (mostly public + Federal Reserve): 2.06% Nonmarketable (mostly gov): 2.97%

JoshZumbrun	697839078566285312	2016-02-11T17:46:16	JackF2323 I dunno, how so? Or rather, how much more of a shell game than trying to boost economy by moving positive rates?
JoshZumbrun	697836226913660929	2016-02-11T17:34:56	RalphMus neg short-term rates impose costs if the bank *doesn't* lend. If they do lend they avoid the negative rates...
JoshZumbrun	697835834884648960	2016-02-11T17:33:22	JackF2323 the idea here is that the way to do neg rates is to make IOR negative ...

JoshZumbrun	697472279375179776	2016-02-10T17:28:44	georgepearkes but I think you're imagining that I'm promoting some sort of populism on IOER here that I'm honestly not promoting
JoshZumbrun	697472112043409408	2016-02-10T17:28:04	georgepearkes I do think it's relevant context, in understanding Congress's behavior here, that reserves wildly higher now than 06
JoshZumbrun	697465163776159744	2016-02-10T17:00:27	georgepearkes lol me? I haven't written on this in 2+ years. I've not been briefing Congress on the questions they asked today.

JoshZumbrun	697455831638523904	2016-02-10T16:23:23	georgepearkes they put in all this brilliant work making sure the tools worked technically and didn't even realize they had political issue
JoshZumbrun	697454165946208256	2016-02-10T16:16:45	georgepearkes I bet they're regretting not pushing back harder when Alan Blinder et al framed it as "paying banks not to lend"
JoshZumbrun	697451460972437504	2016-02-10T16:06:00	georgepearkes that said, it would *really* help the Fed if there were better passthrough from IOER to deposit rates
JoshZumbrun	697449583534809088	2016-02-10T15:58:33	georgepearkes yeah, you know I totally get this, right? I know what IOER is. I'm saying that it's clearly becoming an issue for Congres.
JoshZumbrun	697448778056523776	2016-02-10T15:55:21	georgepearkes Hensarling, Waters and Mulvaney all three opened with criticism of it

JoshZumbrun	697447727261679616	2016-02-10T15:51:10	When Congress passed law allowing interest on reserves, it applied to $1.7 billion. Today, applies to $2.3 TRILLION

JoshZumbrun	697191938395676672	2016-02-09T22:54:45	ErinTaylor14 NickTimiraos yeah, but this has so little to do with how Congress actually operates that I don't think it's very relevant

JoshZumbrun	696724203656122369	2016-02-08T15:56:09	sosofancy I dunno, seems like it's the firms that confuse correlation and causation. The media ridicules this stuff.

JoshZumbrun	695288053540196352	2016-02-04T16:49:24	mattyglesias sort of weird to start that argument with the Arthur Burns Fed though
JoshZumbrun	695285279461138433	2016-02-04T16:38:23	davidcaryhart I think most serious estimates of productivity bias aren't that large (like &lt;1%) and thus wouldn't change overall trend much
JoshZumbrun	695283885815521281	2016-02-04T16:32:50	econjared so it shows a rise in slack correlates with a subsequent fall in productivity? Did I unpack that right?
JoshZumbrun	695283065506156544	2016-02-04T16:29:35	chmtp fair, I recognize there are arguments against equilibrium rates and NAIRU sort of stuff that would make the chart irrelevant
JoshZumbrun	695280334947106818	2016-02-04T16:18:44	econjared jbarro greg_ip so in Granger test slack "causes" prod growth? Isn't your thesis that slack causes prod decline?
JoshZumbrun	695277530660626432	2016-02-04T16:07:35	chmtp ha, if one believes unemployment is independent of business cycles then there's really no point trying to engage with them
JoshZumbrun	695275778343321600	2016-02-04T16:00:37	chmtp of course if you think NAIRU is lower then the point is even stronger

JoshZumbrun	694967107004547073	2016-02-03T19:34:04	nicotapial in available data it'd be "all employed people" but I want to see it from "employed people actively job hunting"
JoshZumbrun	694964230139809792	2016-02-03T19:22:38	nick_bunker all the more reason it would *really* help if some state tried this out
JoshZumbrun	694963902707322880	2016-02-03T19:21:20	nick_bunker  job-to-job rate is not what I'm talking about. Most people in a job are not actively looking for next job.
JoshZumbrun	694963786457939968	2016-02-03T19:20:53	ernietedeschi bencasselman nick_bunker I would expect quitter-&gt;E to be much higher because most E are not actively trying to -&gt;anywhere
JoshZumbrun	694963402586853376	2016-02-03T19:19:21	bencasselman nick_bunker I'm saying an employed active job hunter will fare much better than unemployed-from-quitting active-job-hunter
JoshZumbrun	694963013837807616	2016-02-03T19:17:48	bencasselman nick_bunker don't think you can construct the comparable I'm suggesting: job-finding rate of employed people actively looking
JoshZumbrun	694962688439488513	2016-02-03T19:16:31	nick_bunker doubt it unless it has a category for employed-but-looking?
JoshZumbrun	694962425012080640	2016-02-03T19:15:28	WillEvans215 a promo like that sure might make a lot more furniture customers go to the restaurant...
JoshZumbrun	694961359323320320	2016-02-03T19:11:14	nick_bunker but my hunch is chance of getting job after quitting is *wildly lower* than chance of getting job while still hired elsewhere
JoshZumbrun	694961206117949440	2016-02-03T19:10:37	nick_bunker definitely need a state to pilot program it
JoshZumbrun	694960614553337856	2016-02-03T19:08:16	BrianRKnight trending better sounds like a rate of change.. he's not saying the number of customers is higher, is he?
JoshZumbrun	694960246608027648	2016-02-03T19:06:49	BrianRKnight wouldn't restaurant foot traffic be higher if rising share of furniture customers going to restaurant?
JoshZumbrun	694959954785124354	2016-02-03T19:05:39	BenDWalsh right - figures could be rising share of furniture customers going to eat. Doesn't mean significant number go just for the food?
JoshZumbrun	694959748366622720	2016-02-03T19:04:50	salimfurth Not saying it's bad food. But is WaPo sure this isn't explained by rising share of furniture customers eating the food?
JoshZumbrun	694959368593399808	2016-02-03T19:03:19	BrianRKnight Wouldn't these numbers more likely be explained by a rising share of furniture customers eating the food?
JoshZumbrun	694958730937499650	2016-02-03T19:00:47	Wait, is this right? Does faster growth in food than furniture mean people go just to eat?

JoshZumbrun	694932087535706112	2016-02-03T17:14:55	nick_bunker "I hate my boss, I'll quit, get QI and get job X after I destress" 2 mo later: "We have no jobs at X." "But my QI is out soon."
JoshZumbrun	694929347195596800	2016-02-03T17:04:02	nick_bunker so maybe it creates more leverage for current employees but less leverage for switchers who go to quitter dole. Maybe net+? Hm.
JoshZumbrun	694928562508414977	2016-02-03T17:00:55	nick_bunker oh, hm, that's interesting claim... need to ponder that
JoshZumbrun	694927772448354304	2016-02-03T16:57:46	nick_bunker for involuntarily laid off worker, yes. But the quitter would probably reduce his leverage going from job to a quitters dole.
JoshZumbrun	694926937576366085	2016-02-03T16:54:27	nick_bunker seems likely to me that quitting leads to wage gains because of the labor market leverage one has when deciding whether to quit
JoshZumbrun	694926562160951296	2016-02-03T16:52:58	nick_bunker I hadn't read this. interesting idea but are you sure quitting, by itself, is what helps economy and should be incentivized?
JoshZumbrun	694918964460265472	2016-02-03T16:22:46	Capitalics true too but that's basically a problem with every chart about the economy :) Great Recession was wild, terrible event
JoshZumbrun	694918352414834688	2016-02-03T16:20:20	Capitalics separate issue but I think his point is mostly right too
JoshZumbrun	694918074806444032	2016-02-03T16:19:14	dandolfa I tend to think marginal schools don't get appropriate discipline (market or otherwise)... so cut enrollment there, sure.

JoshZumbrun	694225905212854273	2016-02-01T18:28:48	joe_atikian billygriffin22 that's fair. There's definitely two camps of what caused manu decline: some blame tech some blame globaization

JoshZumbrun	694221785416466432	2016-02-01T18:12:26	billygriffin22 but a lot of people argue globalization is precisely the key way that capital dominated domestic labor, no?
JoshZumbrun	694220101969649664	2016-02-01T18:05:44	billygriffin22 sure, but many people who trot out that chart are also *emphasizing* the point that manufacturing has declined

JoshZumbrun	694200065418727424	2016-02-01T16:46:07	joe_atikian oh, are you in Canada? I just mean that owning becomes more beneficial/less risky the longer you plan to be there
JoshZumbrun	694198246382686209	2016-02-01T16:38:54	joe_atikian lifestyle matters less than how long you expect to live in one place
JoshZumbrun	694195986722328576	2016-02-01T16:29:55	joe_atikian I have always thought that's wrong calculation. You can't live in a stock portfolio. Have to compare buying to renting.
JoshZumbrun	694192549389570048	2016-02-01T16:16:15	joe_atikian still, decision to rent or buy is generally different from decision to live in multi-family or not
JoshZumbrun	694189315446947840	2016-02-01T16:03:24	joe_atikian most places you can buy a condo if you like living on top of your neighbors
JoshZumbrun	694189143258222593	2016-02-01T16:02:43	ClaesBell yep, taxes are a relevant thing to consider if you're debating whether to rent or own!
JoshZumbrun	694186681898000384	2016-02-01T15:52:56	instructive that nearly all high-wealth/high-income people own their home: this would be a bizarre outcome if it was bad financial decision
JoshZumbrun	694186407447924736	2016-02-01T15:51:51	Whether to buy a house depends primarily on how long you expect to live there and what it costs to rent the same place
JoshZumbrun	694185660601798657	2016-02-01T15:48:53	I like ATabarrok but don't think this is a very good overview of whether or not to buy a house

JoshZumbrun	694172329581084672	2016-02-01T14:55:55	Fascinating research on whether grads of elite schools earn more money (in most fields yes, but not as much in STEM)

JoshZumbrun	692778557488152576	2016-01-28T18:37:33	boes_ DavidBeckworth ritholtz now I sort of want to make my version of this list
JoshZumbrun	692778221910233088	2016-01-28T18:36:13	boes_ DavidBeckworth ritholtz (the 2% rate/signal mistake was 987th biggest. Other mistakes that quarter much more important)
JoshZumbrun	692777925863677952	2016-01-28T18:35:03	boes_ DavidBeckworth ritholtz to be clear, Fed made policy mistake in Q3 08. I'd just rank it like 987th biggest policy error of crisis
JoshZumbrun	692777012897943552	2016-01-28T18:31:25	boes_ DavidBeckworth ritholtz and if you remove assumption of omnipotence, the interpretation of the term structure goes different ways
JoshZumbrun	692776858430083074	2016-01-28T18:30:48	boes_ DavidBeckworth ritholtz it gets to be an inkblot test pretty quickly. I see no evidence Fed is omnipotent on the term structure.
JoshZumbrun	692776565206335488	2016-01-28T18:29:38	DavidBeckworth ritholtz yeah, I understand it. I just disagree. But anyway my points all stand even if you want to call it Q2+Q3.
JoshZumbrun	692775034637717504	2016-01-28T18:23:34	DavidBeckworth ritholtz they cut ON April 30th... the only meetings they didn't cut were June 25, Aug 5 and Sep 16. Fair to call that Q3.
JoshZumbrun	692773970366599169	2016-01-28T18:19:20	cullenroche completely agree... I think one can reasonably make case that by 2005 or 2006 what happened next was all but unstoppable
JoshZumbrun	692773033287798784	2016-01-28T18:15:36	DavidBeckworth ritholtz Only late June, August, Sep meeting that they didn't cut. Fair to call that Q3. They cut in April.

JoshZumbrun	692754666837393412	2016-01-28T17:02:37	natehanco MattZeitlin hey, no doubt that some schools had cable in every classroom in 1986. Mine didn't even have that in late 90s tho...
JoshZumbrun	692752511774625794	2016-01-28T16:54:04	natehanco MattZeitlin just learned CNN was only national news carrying it live. So many schools really had cable in every classroom in 86?

JoshZumbrun	692736532923445248	2016-01-28T15:50:34	natehanco MattZeitlin and more importantly, I wasn't even in school in 1986. Yet still I think I remember it.
JoshZumbrun	692736421988306944	2016-01-28T15:50:08	natehanco MattZeitlin but my school only had a few TVs-- not enough for every classroom to watch something live

JoshZumbrun	692735438755332096	2016-01-28T15:46:13	natehanco MattZeitlin no doubt that some people did, but just think that many people will misremember this sort of thing from childhood

JoshZumbrun	691807778692796416	2016-01-26T02:20:02	JoshZumbrun beckybowers let me rephrase: employment *stop improving* has been necessary(but not sufficient) for recessions in last 40Y (5)
JoshZumbrun	691805946834751489	2016-01-26T02:12:45	JoshZumbrun beckybowers last recession started w/ unemp still falling was 74, so I guess you can say it IS a necessary condition!! (4)
JoshZumbrun	691805195588784129	2016-01-26T02:09:46	JoshZumbrun beckybowers on the other hand, stagnant unemployment or even slight raises have not always translated into recessions (3)
JoshZumbrun	691804725990268929	2016-01-26T02:07:54	JoshZumbrun beckybowers but it's indeed totally fair to say they stopped falling way ahead. Often while stocks were peaking (2)
JoshZumbrun	691804331763470336	2016-01-26T02:06:20	JoshZumbrun beckybowers went back to my time series. It's not fair to say unemployment raised ahead of recessions (1)

JoshZumbrun	691737778715922432	2016-01-25T21:41:52	adamshersh (higher national income but higher inequality seems like a very plausible outcome too that neither paper pays much attention to)

JoshZumbrun	691734779176185856	2016-01-25T21:29:57	adamshersh so what would be plausible outcomes for income and exports? Are they likely to decline from the deal?
JoshZumbrun	691733505810653184	2016-01-25T21:24:54	adamshersh I don't like their euphemism of "adjustment costs on some workers" but looks like that is in their model
JoshZumbrun	691732140090720256	2016-01-25T21:19:28	adamshersh (at first blush, teeny rise in income + modest increase in exports doesn't seem like an unrealistic outcome from a trade deal)

JoshZumbrun	687694726321971200	2016-01-14T17:56:14	One more thought -- much rent-seeking activity easily shifts to another place/type of firm,etc. when it's sloppily identified and targeted.
JoshZumbrun	687693608271482880	2016-01-14T17:51:47	RuthlessGravity big law would be another example where you have lots of rent-seeking that's maybe impossible to disentangle
JoshZumbrun	687692651106193408	2016-01-14T17:47:59	RuthlessGravity I'm not disputing that banks do "rent-seeking" but I think it's harder than Jim does to identify which actions are &amp; aren't
JoshZumbrun	687687620923650048	2016-01-14T17:28:00	ernietedeschi jimtankersley or how about unions? etc.
JoshZumbrun	687686437584662528	2016-01-14T17:23:17	ernietedeschi jimtankersley I'm just concerned that when you probe on this issue there's little depth to it beyond the sloganeering
JoshZumbrun	687686321595396096	2016-01-14T17:22:50	ernietedeschi jimtankersley or simply what about the right of citizens to petition the government?
JoshZumbrun	687685973782708224	2016-01-14T17:21:27	ernietedeschi jimtankersley what about lobbying for a financial transaction tax?
JoshZumbrun	687685537591898112	2016-01-14T17:19:43	ernietedeschi jimtankersley no, Jim, that's great research that *some* lobbying is rent-seeking.
JoshZumbrun	687683918976413696	2016-01-14T17:13:17	salimfurth jimtankersley but this is a fairly glib notion of what most lobbies, which are often membership associations, actually do
JoshZumbrun	687682885650886656	2016-01-14T17:09:11	jimtankersley "lobbying is rent-seeking full stop" strikes me more as sorta populism rather than actually wrestling with the issue
JoshZumbrun	687681486909222918	2016-01-14T17:03:37	In practice, I'd guess virtually nobody views what they do as rent-seeking. When is securitization rent-seeking instead of risk allocation?
JoshZumbrun	687680865455976448	2016-01-14T17:01:09	We are maybe going to need some clearer definitions of "rent-seeking" if we are going to do anything about it...

JoshZumbrun	684512062471536640	2016-01-05T23:09:27	bourreelam so you 1) force lenders to offer credit cards to anyone at 15% or 2) totally ok if low-credit borrowers just ineligible or 3)???
JoshZumbrun	684500123846635521	2016-01-05T22:22:01	KYColC there used to be a Richard Fisher parody account: FakeRichFisher although seems whoever ran it got bored and gave it up
JoshZumbrun	684492826839789569	2016-01-05T21:53:01	Twitter should raise and lower the character limit based on how noisy it gets, like the Fed.  Oscars - 20 characters Monday 3am - 10,000
JoshZumbrun	684470704272703488	2016-01-05T20:25:07	RuthlessGravity but why would anyone make a loan at 4% when the Fed will pay you 0.5% not to?
JoshZumbrun	684470209311281152	2016-01-05T20:23:09	Here's more from Sanders. Hey, what Fed policy created $2.4t in reserves at banks?  
JoshZumbrun	684469207577313280	2016-01-05T20:19:10	boes_ well, eg, a guy at this site called BusinessInsider once framed it this way and if framing catches on etc.  
JoshZumbrun	684467511530778624	2016-01-05T20:12:26	The problem is bigger than Sanders -- it's the whole framing that IOER is a system by which "Fed gives Wall Street banks money for nothing"
JoshZumbrun	684467214469197825	2016-01-05T20:11:15	boes_ well, does this argument about IOER end with Sanders? I think lots of people buy into this framing.
JoshZumbrun	684466754496663552	2016-01-05T20:09:25	One interest rate increase under the Fed's belt and IOER is already having some political problems 
JoshZumbrun	684448071263109120	2016-01-05T18:55:11	michaelsderby ylanmui It's a combination James Bond/Fed District reference

JoshZumbrun	684443032675053569	2016-01-05T18:35:09	salimfurth maybe you were on summer vacation when the news hit? 
JoshZumbrun	684442539643023360	2016-01-05T18:33:12	Have confirmed with Rochester that this is, in fact, Kocherlakota and not a parody account (if you were worried) 
JoshZumbrun	684411267109531648	2016-01-05T16:28:56	ff Just learned that former Minneapolis Fed president kocherlakota009 has joined twitter
JoshZumbrun	684410891475931138	2016-01-05T16:27:26	This chart isn't wrong but 2000 was a major cyclical peak and 2009 a severe trough

JoshZumbrun	684170026706952192	2016-01-05T00:30:20	Manish_05Singh prchovanec Neil_Irwin and the flip side is one can also say IOER boosts deposit rates for customers too -- yay etc
JoshZumbrun	684170026421751810	2016-01-05T00:30:20	Manish_05Singh prchovanec Neil_Irwin so it's question: doing so directly is dramatically worse politics than indirectly? Maybe maybe not.
JoshZumbrun	684170026392367104	2016-01-05T00:30:20	Manish_05Singh prchovanec Neil_Irwin I think we'll very likely find out what happens at 1% but Fed has always set minimum overnight (...)
JoshZumbrun	684158095136808960	2016-01-04T23:42:55	Manish_05Singh prchovanec Neil_Irwin and in reality all the bank will say is "mortgage rates are 6%" not "fed paying me not to lend"
JoshZumbrun	684157941537222660	2016-01-04T23:42:18	Manish_05Singh prchovanec Neil_Irwin I'm not sure this is any different than when Fed funds is at 5% or whatever
JoshZumbrun	684154656851771396	2016-01-04T23:29:15	prchovanec Manish_05Singh Neil_Irwin for hyperinflation? Or for like 4-5%?
JoshZumbrun	684150023781769217	2016-01-04T23:10:51	and we also know ISIS supports the gold standard, so someone could use that

JoshZumbrun	682676374339858432	2015-12-31T21:35:05	Rate for top 400 U.S. taxpayers climbed in 2013, reversing trend:  by JoshZumbrun 
JoshZumbrun	682669864780185600	2015-12-31T21:09:13	Good piece from econjared on how to understand this week's news about extremely rich people's taxes: 
JoshZumbrun	682661005470515200	2015-12-31T20:34:01	Tax rate for top 400 U.S. taxpayers climbed in 2013 writes JoshZumbrun  (via: WSJ) 
JoshZumbrun	682583759573663745	2015-12-31T15:27:04	Joelsberg esoltas is that true? including their VATs? Anyway, I'm making zero claims about international comparison.s
JoshZumbrun	682574915321638913	2015-12-31T14:51:56	Joelsberg esoltas agree that the tax hike here did little to diminish wealth or wealth inequality and have never argued otherwise
JoshZumbrun	682574649746657281	2015-12-31T14:50:52	Joelsberg esoltas extremely wealthy (like this $100m+ group) pay lower effective tax rates than merely wealthy (say the $1m to $10m sort)
JoshZumbrun	682574261182185472	2015-12-31T14:49:20	Joelsberg esoltas so even when you account for payroll taxes wealthy pay more than middle class -- the only catch is that ...
JoshZumbrun	682573898634899456	2015-12-31T14:47:53	Joelsberg esoltas I'm unaware of a metric by which that would be true. Effective middle class income tax rate is like &lt;10%.
JoshZumbrun	682570663815680000	2015-12-31T14:35:02	Joelsberg esoltas no but remember payroll taxes are negligible for people with this much income
