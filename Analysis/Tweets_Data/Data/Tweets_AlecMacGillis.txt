AlecMacGillis	709848474343383040	2016-03-15T21:07:19	The divide here in Dayton is so stark. The professionals are w/ Kasich, the people who work w/ their hands are for Trump. It's that simple.

AlecMacGillis	709834641952411652	2016-03-15T20:12:21	After more than three hours of talking to voters in the Dayton suburbs, just found my first Kasich one. Purely anecdotal, of course.
AlecMacGillis	709830025126780932	2016-03-15T19:54:00	Trump voter in Dayton burb just told me that screening bad Syrians from good ones like "picking gnat shit out of pepper. Good luck w/ that."

AlecMacGillis	709779169488535555	2016-03-15T16:31:55	.jpodhoretz may be on to something here, tracing Trump to the confluence of Obama election and financial collapse. 
AlecMacGillis	709775829618855937	2016-03-15T16:18:39	Midwest reality: suburb of Dayton has to pay $1.07 million to replace fire truck that crashed en route to heroin OD.

AlecMacGillis	709591007675949056	2016-03-15T04:04:14	While NRO's harsh new rhetoric against white working class dependency is jarring, it's what I was getting at here: 
AlecMacGillis	709582278087806976	2016-03-15T03:29:33	Wow. National Review's raw, undisguished contempt on white working class makes Trumpism seems by contrast attracive 
AlecMacGillis	709579255168901120	2016-03-15T03:17:32	AlecMacGillis I'm going to head over to NRO and count how many times they criticized Obamas "bitter clingers" line, then go kill myself.

AlecMacGillis	709577636205502464	2016-03-15T03:11:06	It's pretty damn startling, and telling, to see the right turning on the white working-class like this: 
AlecMacGillis	709573145259282432	2016-03-15T02:53:15	Um, what in the world is Clinton campaign thinking having a campaign fundraiser (w/ Chelsea, no less) at Theranos??

AlecMacGillis	709397982362398721	2016-03-14T15:17:13	Simply extraordinary. Step back and recall what was expected there not long ago: the Jeb-Rubio home-state showdown.

AlecMacGillis	709106689656500224	2016-03-13T19:59:44	Trump gets q from a Native American woman about whether he'd apologize to them. "I'll look into it," he says. Asks for a "nicer" question.
AlecMacGillis	709103890780856320	2016-03-13T19:48:36	Woman from Nicaragua tells Trump how much she likes him. "We are going to do so well with the Hispanics," he says. Climbs down to hug her.

AlecMacGillis	709102506459209729	2016-03-13T19:43:06	2 young supporters just asked Trump about the OH SOS barring 17 y. olds from voting next wk and he had no idea what they were talking about.

AlecMacGillis	709097511839997952	2016-03-13T19:23:15	Weird moment as Trump starts telling Cincy crowd how bad heroin problem is in NH, as if not realizing that the problem's even bigger here.
AlecMacGillis	709096064117248001	2016-03-13T19:17:30	A whole bunch of people in Trump's Cincy event are Kentuckians who already voted, while many Ohioans were shut out. Maybe better screening?
AlecMacGillis	709095311227142146	2016-03-13T19:14:31	Trump hits Kasich for being an un-serious candidate. "You're running for president and the only thing you watch on TV is Golf Channel?"
AlecMacGillis	709094563462455296	2016-03-13T19:11:32	"We love you, outside," Trump tells the thousands that couldn't fit into his Cincy-exurb event. That's a pretty good slogan for his appeal.

AlecMacGillis	709075135525998592	2016-03-13T17:54:20	Fascinating: outspoken Sheriff Rick Jones, speaking for Trump outside Cincy, hits Kasich from left for pushing anti-public union SB5 in '11.
AlecMacGillis	709073410941390848	2016-03-13T17:47:29	brianros1 Right. But it's a real break from Palin-style populism. Less Southern, more Rust Belt/classic rock in its flavor.
AlecMacGillis	709071307090972672	2016-03-13T17:39:08	Surprised Trump's soundtrack hasn't been more discussed. It's Stones, Billy Joel etc not the country rock most associated w/ right populism.

AlecMacGillis	708124913433841664	2016-03-11T02:58:30	Trump keeps promising neutrality on Israel-Palestine. Not only keeps winning GOP primaries, keeps winning among evangelicals.

AlecMacGillis	708116459214475264	2016-03-11T02:24:54	Rubio’s definition of a a debt crisis—most of the budget going to social spending—is not a debt crisis. There are these things called taxes.

AlecMacGillis	704864899873296386	2016-03-02T03:04:22	Big thing to watch: Trump still only candidate above 20% in Alabama (with 30% in). If it stays that way, he gets all statewide delegates.
AlecMacGillis	704858951351988227	2016-03-02T02:40:44	So, NOW can we stop making big momentum-shift predictions off of debate wins?

AlecMacGillis	704857481995030528	2016-03-02T02:34:53	hilzoy I'd have expected a Christie-type mod to win it. Rubio just wasn't right fit for northern blue states.
AlecMacGillis	704857217674186752	2016-03-02T02:33:50	One helped him win MA. The other helped with some other states. 
AlecMacGillis	704856436346646529	2016-03-02T02:30:44	In a sense, MA is the key. You'd expect "moderate" guy to win it, even as Cruz and Trump win in South, Texas. But Rubio got blown out in MA.

AlecMacGillis	704853307752378368	2016-03-02T02:18:18	Bottom line: Cruz won his home turf, Texas. Rubio won his home turf, the Beltway. Former's a state, the latter is not.

AlecMacGillis	704852162438963201	2016-03-02T02:13:45	Said same in last debate. Clearly resonated in Macon, Brockton and Oklahoma City.

AlecMacGillis	704840477141540865	2016-03-02T01:27:19	amk44139 No, it's definitely not. Point is that GOP (i.e. white) voters in heavily mixed Southern counties are going BIG for Trump.

AlecMacGillis	698650810809524224	2016-02-13T23:31:48	The notion that 9 months before an election is too close to consider SCOTUS nom is ultimate proof of the hegemony of the permanent campaign.

AlecMacGillis	698336403780988928	2016-02-13T02:42:27	HeerJeet I'd say both. It's deliberate in the sense that he needs to explain why she'd actually get stuff done. But it's awkward, too.
AlecMacGillis	698333966277828609	2016-02-13T02:32:46	chrislhayes EricBoehlert Exactly. Yeesh. Which is understandable, in a way--he's trying to explain why she'd get more done than Obama has.
AlecMacGillis	698333772173803521	2016-02-13T02:32:00	HeerJeet Thing is, it's an understandable tweak! Somehow he needs to explain why she'll get more done than Obama vs staunch GOP opposition.
AlecMacGillis	698333195410931712	2016-02-13T02:29:42	HeerJeet Check the transcript. The article overstated it, but there was still a tweak of Obama: that she, unlike him, was a "change-maker."
AlecMacGillis	698332788244635648	2016-02-13T02:28:05	EricBoehlert Eh, the article may have overstated it, but there was still an implied swipe: that HRC, unlike Obama, was a true change-maker.

AlecMacGillis	698273816112271360	2016-02-12T22:33:45	DBMcWeeberton irin I dunno. Sure as heck sounds like he's saying she'll be a "change-maker" in a way that Obama wasn't able to be.
AlecMacGillis	698265542440853504	2016-02-12T22:00:53	IChotiner irin ...I also suspect that old habits die hard. Remember, he even took some more overt shots at Obama in 2012.

AlecMacGillis	697284698511380480	2016-02-10T05:03:21	sullivanamy Right. Though those guys already had a guy to vote for in '08. Q is what drove so many precincts she won then against her now.

AlecMacGillis	697269764503183361	2016-02-10T04:04:01	In other words, there are a whole lot of states out there that are better suited to Trump than the one he just won by almost 20 points.
AlecMacGillis	697269378853793793	2016-02-10T04:02:29	Consider: Trump is famously stronger with lower educated voters. NH is one of most educated states in country. He won by almost 20 points.
AlecMacGillis	697268914963791874	2016-02-10T04:00:38	politicaljimbo maggieNYT Sure. But point is, there are 16 percent of NH voters drawn to that sort of Republican. Then Huntsman, now Kasich
AlecMacGillis	697268198698283008	2016-02-10T03:57:47	There was only one winner on the Republican side tonight: the dude with orange hair. 
AlecMacGillis	697268037091790848	2016-02-10T03:57:09	Reality check in order: Kasich's tally, while impressive, still below that of one Jon Huntsman.
AlecMacGillis	697266561107828736	2016-02-10T03:51:17	If nothing else, Kasich's 2nd place helps justify the (let's face it) rather disproportionate amount of national political-press ink he got.
AlecMacGillis	697264702368382976	2016-02-10T03:43:54	Curious why people think Christie didn't do better in NH. All those town halls, ISIS helping his nat sec talk, his addiction riff...8 pct?

AlecMacGillis	697253053527891968	2016-02-10T02:57:36	Many HRC fans reacting by saying, "She'll win anyway bc South." That's likely true! But doesn't really address warning sign in this result.
AlecMacGillis	697252432112435200	2016-02-10T02:55:08	Devingo913 True! But you get my point. Weird what a big role the last debate played in both races.
AlecMacGillis	697251506832203776	2016-02-10T02:51:28	DanaHoule Seriously, if Hillary loses those working-class precincts in Manchester where she killed Obama, there's something going on here.
AlecMacGillis	697251377530195969	2016-02-10T02:50:57	DanaHoule But exit polls in IA showed same thing! He did way better w/ lower-income whites than Dean, Obama. It's a different coalition.
AlecMacGillis	697250622849032194	2016-02-10T02:47:57	DanaHoule C'mon, you know what I mean. In past, challengers got beaten by establishment Dem among middle/lower-income whites. Not Sanders.
AlecMacGillis	697249601183735808	2016-02-10T02:43:53	So just as in '08, the young star w/ the bounce out of IA saw his polls rise in NH, then faltered after Sat night debate. Striking parallel.
AlecMacGillis	697247374276739072	2016-02-10T02:35:02	Pretty striking. Not so encouraging for Sanders, and means HRC's vote tally will be far, far lower than '08. 
AlecMacGillis	697246391089963012	2016-02-10T02:31:08	Wow. And appropriately colored like the winner's hair. 
AlecMacGillis	697245506653851648	2016-02-10T02:27:37	Remarkable. He's broken the model for Dem primary challengers. He's not "wine-track" like Hart, Bradley, Dean, etc. 
AlecMacGillis	697244383985405953	2016-02-10T02:23:09	Pretty tough competing with the last Dem concession speech in NH, which apparently became a video that some people watched.
AlecMacGillis	697242695945822213	2016-02-10T02:16:27	An impressive feat for Kasich. But hard to imagine a state better tailored to him. Including OH.
AlecMacGillis	697240971965304833	2016-02-10T02:09:36	Bayroff Good point. They were pretty clever about it in '08, did a last-minute under the radar hit attacking BHO as weak on choice.
AlecMacGillis	697239978330497024	2016-02-10T02:05:39	Wonder how much HRC's NH dropoff from 08 is her not trying as hard there. They went hard negative vs BHO (on choice etc.) Less so this time.
AlecMacGillis	697238224901709825	2016-02-10T01:58:41	EbonyStarr5 Not my point at all. Point is how freakish this is, for Sanders to outperform one of Dems' greatest candidates in this state.
AlecMacGillis	697235239928619008	2016-02-10T01:46:49	Two things can both be true: 1) VT helped Sanders a lot in NH 2) This is a remarkably big win in a state where HRC has real ties, history.
AlecMacGillis	697232654379442176	2016-02-10T01:36:33	zmcdade Right. I'm not necessarily attributing it to him. I'm saying how nuts that Sanders got more than BHO in same state vs same person.
AlecMacGillis	697231454149808128	2016-02-10T01:31:47	zmcdade Totally. But it's still pretty striking: he accomplished something even Obama could not, beating her in a state she's strong in.
AlecMacGillis	697231205062873088	2016-02-10T01:30:47	JohnSilencio He is not Obama redux. He will likely lose. But he did just trounce HRC  in a state she's been strong in, which is striking.
