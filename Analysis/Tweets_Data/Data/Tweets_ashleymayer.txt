ashleymayer	684647733655769089	2016-01-06T08:08:34	LauraGlu I did! Was fascinating.
ashleymayer	684594787672915968	2016-01-06T04:38:11	Just realized Whole30 is Lent for millenials
ashleymayer	684638066418438145	2016-01-06T07:30:09	The official statement from the DPRK government would be hilarious if it weren't terrifying.  
ashleymayer	684623922780712961	2016-01-06T06:33:57	OMG. First 9 people answer Qs about their "power lunch" outfit. And then there's Kissinger.  
ashleymayer	684621131815321600	2016-01-06T06:22:52	Here she is at 2.5 and 3 months, already too big for her bed. Oops. 
ashleymayer	684620894497419265	2016-01-06T06:21:55	daiwaka thanks! She's a Brittany spaniel, which I had never heard of until we got her :)
ashleymayer	684619210702467072	2016-01-06T06:15:14	darth a perma-puppy!
ashleymayer	684619008977440768	2016-01-06T06:14:26	She's almost certainly the smallest brittany in the world (under 25lbs)
ashleymayer	684618783286104064	2016-01-06T06:13:32	You know how goldfish kept in a bowl  stay small? I think we accidentally did that to our puppy with her tiny bed 😱 
ashleymayer	684587020216225792	2016-01-06T04:07:19	sarthakgh yeah snapchat is fascinating
ashleymayer	684585625438130176	2016-01-06T04:01:46	sarthakgh I would argue that there's a very clear mainstream use case today. Maybe that will shift over time.
ashleymayer	684583694024101892	2016-01-06T03:54:06	The posture among startup folks would suggest they're taking the expression "heads down" a little too literally.
ashleymayer	684582668508368896	2016-01-06T03:50:01	sarthakgh maybe, but the difference is that they use the same 5% (or whatever % it is). So at least there's a core product!

ashleymayer	683409200471359488	2016-01-02T22:07:05	Welp, the man can write. 
ashleymayer	683401021540806656	2016-01-02T21:34:35	Thanks, Russia, for making the rest of the world look sober by comparison.  
ashleymayer	683390741834420225	2016-01-02T20:53:44	Prediction: there will be lots of noise about startup valuations in 2016, and the companies that just stay focused on execution will win.
ashleymayer	683363224117313536	2016-01-02T19:04:23	SG 😱
ashleymayer	683355562751307777	2016-01-02T18:33:56	SG I don't know too many of those (in SF) :) It's possible that the age when people buy homes is just slipping back / driven by kids.
ashleymayer	683353581311803393	2016-01-02T18:26:04	IMO it's not just about cost -- home ownership isn't as important/symbolic to millennials as prior generations.
