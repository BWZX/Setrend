ezraklein	690403822045380609	2016-01-22T05:21:12	The case against Trump is less about ideology than it is about temperament. Trump can change his ideology. He can’t change his temperament.

ezraklein	690396634165960706	2016-01-22T04:52:39	But even as the National Review tries to fight Trump, I don’t think they’re seriously reckoning with conservstism’s role in creating him
ezraklein	690396192782585856	2016-01-22T04:50:53	Hot take: it’s good the National Review is assembling conservatives to fight Trumpism, even if it’s unlikely to work

ezraklein	689906906643595264	2016-01-20T20:26:39	The difference here is Sanders wants the Dem establishment to rally around him, while he welcomes the hatred of the financial sector, etc
ezraklein	689906385430048768	2016-01-20T20:24:34	But there's a difference between the establishment Sanders is fighting (Wall Street, etc) and the establishment that's fighting him
ezraklein	689906187861504000	2016-01-20T20:23:47	I think PP and HRC are clearly part of the Democratic establishment, and Sanders is taking that establishment on:

ezraklein	689095654648451073	2016-01-18T14:43:01	3 winners and 2 losers from Sunday night's Democratic presidential debate: 
ezraklein	689089110972182528	2016-01-18T14:17:01	"Sanders demands to be taken seriously as someone who very well could be a major party presidential nominee" 
ezraklein	689000317602648064	2016-01-18T08:24:11	Some thoughts on Bernie Sanders' single-payer plan, which I don't think quite adds up: 
ezraklein	688950387756388353	2016-01-18T05:05:47	Agree --&gt; "Sanders ... finally debated like a candidate who thinks he stands a good chance of winning" 
ezraklein	688936987668041728	2016-01-18T04:12:32	Single payer's better, but anything we get goes through system that produced what we have  
ezraklein	688919662529241088	2016-01-18T03:03:41	My God. No reporter has ever thought of doing this.  
ezraklein	688935221320794112	2016-01-18T04:05:31	And particularly when you're making specific promises about how much is covered, and how large the savings will be 
ezraklein	688935067230441472	2016-01-18T04:04:54	But I really disagree with that, particularly when you're trying to sell the country on something as big and disruptive as single payer
ezraklein	688934930760380416	2016-01-18T04:04:21	I think a criticism I'll get of this piece is that this is just a campaign proposal, and campaign proposals don't need to be detailed
ezraklein	688933899657986048	2016-01-18T04:00:16	I was expecting a lot more from Bernie Sanders' single payer plan than this:  
ezraklein	688920818219220992	2016-01-18T03:08:17	This is the first debate I've seen where the YouTube integration is really well done
ezraklein	688917732096528384	2016-01-18T02:56:01	To put an earlier tweet more simply, Sanders hasn't pushed Clinton further to the left so much as he's pushed her further towards Obama

ezraklein	688915093795373056	2016-01-18T02:45:32	The CW was that Sanders would push Clinton further left, which I don't think has happened. But he's pushed her to be much more pro-Obamacare
ezraklein	688914763045146624	2016-01-18T02:44:13	I really disagree with Sanders' view that congressional gridlock is driven by money. Big money likes infrastructure bills, for instance!
ezraklein	688913916018049024	2016-01-18T02:40:51	The argument that it's dangerous to try to start a whole new health care debate when Obamacare remains fragile is worth taking seriously
ezraklein	688913804676087808	2016-01-18T02:40:25	I was critical of the case Clinton was making against Sanders' health plan last week  but this her best argument
