dats	695016975567863808	2016-02-03T22:52:14	Ok final few tweets because this has gone on... People will say the UK is difficult. The UK isn't as accepting, they'll say.
dats	695016673510817792	2016-02-03T22:51:02	A lot of Muslims think the govt only talks to groups that focus on counter-terror. Reaching out to others isn't difficult.
dats	695016371726454785	2016-02-03T22:49:50	Here's how the UK gov gets better: Restart the dialogue, make it honest and clear. And then review the groups it works with.
dats	695016081103126528	2016-02-03T22:48:41	There's a reason that Muslims feel like they're targeted by the government and share the hell out of articles that appear to prove that.
dats	695015521356480514	2016-02-03T22:46:27	Now some of that is obviously needed. But it's about the approach: UK Muslims want to feel like their prime minister thinks they're British.
dats	695015203688284161	2016-02-03T22:45:11	Here's what Muslims in the UK are told: Speak out against ISIS, your madrasahs are bad and start learning English or we'll kick you out.
dats	695014829904564224	2016-02-03T22:43:42	So basically, you can critique what he said and actions being taken, but by comparison, Britain has a LONG way to go to reach UK Muslims.
dats	695014102536753152	2016-02-03T22:40:49	But he also quotes the prophet (similar to the Golden Rule) -- there's proper thought gone into the approach. 
dats	695013644611018753	2016-02-03T22:39:00	And look how honest and mature this bit is. He admits that law enforcement is targeting Muslim youth. 
dats	695013142762491905	2016-02-03T22:37:00	And Obama genuinely seemed like he empathised with Muslims and had conversations with real, worried, people. 
dats	695012650149941249	2016-02-03T22:35:03	Obama went further too. It's not just about Muslims speaking up. Everyone needs to, he said. 
dats	695012066407616513	2016-02-03T22:32:43	nina_mrs_mummy naturally
dats	695012015031607298	2016-02-03T22:32:31	So yes Muslims should speak out. But it's MORE than just that. We need to amplify positive voice, Obama said. 
dats	695011120311066624	2016-02-03T22:28:58	And Obama definitely had touches of that. But unlike Cameron, it had an added maturity to it. 
dats	695010391269761028	2016-02-03T22:26:04	When David Cameron speaks to Muslims, there's a very obvious frame. ISIL is bad but Muslims need to accept a burden to speak out, for eg.
