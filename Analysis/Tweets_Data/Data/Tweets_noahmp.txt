noahmp	715743357662806020	2016-04-01T03:31:28	AnthroPunk the ? I was asking is: do higher min wages push up prices? I'm not sure -- there may not be enough MW workers for such impact
noahmp	715742316548333568	2016-04-01T03:27:20	AnthroPunk well, we need to unwind the impact of higher prices on the MW worker before judging what is going to help, no?
noahmp	715741797092184065	2016-04-01T03:25:16	AnthroPunk this is more a question of economic mechanics leaving aside the related philosophical topics.

noahmp	699731883303677956	2016-02-16T23:07:36	crystaldbeasley min wage raise will be great for land lords, city dwellers, tech companies, some low skill workers. For others it won't.
noahmp	699731073438056448	2016-02-16T23:04:22	crystaldbeasley sure. How high they should be is also a policy decision. Eg super high state level min wage will hurt rural areas a lot
noahmp	699730069799895040	2016-02-16T23:00:23	crystaldbeasley policy decisions are notorious for creating unintended consequences with devastating effects.

noahmp	699682607890497536	2016-02-16T19:51:47	bluechoochoo well I could see an argument that higher min wage accelerates this. Accelerating that unemployment will cause a lot of pain.
noahmp	699680676572823552	2016-02-16T19:44:07	bluechoochoo slow no cease I would argue. It's a decision based upon  the total net savings one gets with automation, right?
noahmp	699677287533248513	2016-02-16T19:30:39	noahmp it will also be good for landlords. since housing is still a scarce resource, it will suck up all the surplus.

noahmp	699676589236183040	2016-02-16T19:27:52	But I can't see how this will help the poor. This will drive a bigger divide as low skill works are priced out of the labor market.
noahmp	699676030814916609	2016-02-16T19:25:39	This will be good for skilled and mid tier workers. It will also raise prices perhaps (bolster middle class, increase cost of goods sold)
noahmp	699675833015775232	2016-02-16T19:24:52	Higher minimum wages will be bullish for the tech sector. Will drive automation and efficiency through process and human capital improvement
noahmp	699673819946954752	2016-02-16T19:16:52	crystaldbeasley not sure it's that simple. Higher wages likely = higher prices. Low wage employers have low margins already from what I see
