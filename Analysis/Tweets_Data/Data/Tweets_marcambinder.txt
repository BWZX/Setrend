marcambinder	720784612998270976	2016-04-15T01:23:37	There's nothing to the speech issue substantively. But perception-wise, it bolsters everything BernieSanders says about HillaryClinton.
marcambinder	720784082020380673	2016-04-15T01:21:31	The speech thing is stupid but it does hurt HillaryClinton in this primary. She should just release them. And not fight this issue.
marcambinder	720783474081148928	2016-04-15T01:19:06	True, but Sanders knows it and doesn't care.

marcambinder	720775849818005508	2016-04-15T00:48:48	Which is ironic, because BernieSanders is not naturally a Democrat
marcambinder	720775214968123392	2016-04-15T00:46:17	I think, with the obvious exception of potus,  BernieSanders is (now) the most powerful and influential Democrat alive today, by far.

marcambinder	707379370801831936	2016-03-09T01:35:59	Now, what happens if a cornered Trump now attacks JohnKasich? If realDonaldTrump is smart (heh), he won't attack Kasich at all.
marcambinder	707378999643607040	2016-03-09T01:34:30	Point is, there's a lot more to JohnKasich' choices than VP hedging. He's smarter than that.
marcambinder	707378874926047233	2016-03-09T01:34:00	JohnKasich governs voters who are hurting. He gets their pain. He understands Trump's appeals attacking him -- and them -- isn't his m.o.
marcambinder	707378607211941888	2016-03-09T01:32:57	Is VP JohnKasich enough to re-assure the independent/lean GOP women who are dead set against Trump, for example?
marcambinder	707378287010426880	2016-03-09T01:31:40	igorbobic all good in theory. But the reality is messy. Trump needs women more than men.
marcambinder	707378142709583876	2016-03-09T01:31:06	If there's a contested convention, that goodwill gesture might mean something, even to Trump, if Trump has control over his delegates.
marcambinder	707377932528824320	2016-03-09T01:30:16	I think Kasich's refusal to attack Trump is aimed squarely at Trump's supporters, not because he wants to worm his way on to the ticket.
marcambinder	707377688990720000	2016-03-09T01:29:18	Kasich's mo is real. But does a Trump/Kasich ticket make sense outside the realm of fantasy?  Does Trump even want him? Maybe. But.

marcambinder	707376701789999104	2016-03-09T01:25:22	That MSNBC chyron on "Is X Trustworthy" for MI Dems Clinton (58%) vis-a-vis Sanders (80%) seems to be pretty significant. MichiganPrimary
marcambinder	707375869828796416	2016-03-09T01:22:04	It's fairly clear at this point that Donald Trump has won Michigan.
marcambinder	707374285795385344	2016-03-09T01:15:46	Next week, that might change.
marcambinder	707374193822683136	2016-03-09T01:15:24	The GOP race is non zero sum; That's why (even though Cruz and Kasich might get 50+percent together), Trump continues at par for the nom.
marcambinder	707373031660781568	2016-03-09T01:10:47	So there was a Kasich surge in Michigan. But it will be blunted by the fact that that there was also a Cruz surge. 
marcambinder	707345823051472896	2016-03-08T23:22:40	More than 1/3 of MI GOP voters chose the candidate they're voting for within the last week:

marcambinder	704497801401470976	2016-03-01T02:45:39	Seeking facts here, but if this happened as described, makes my blood boil.   
marcambinder	704495972039073792	2016-03-01T02:38:23	Oh, I have one of these. I really do. 
marcambinder	704495635672608768	2016-03-01T02:37:03	I know it's hard for them to communicate about these things, but they're smart and they'll figure out a way.
marcambinder	704495496832757760	2016-03-01T02:36:29	My bias for SecretService is obvious. I admire them. A lot. I'm also a bit biased in favor of the press and to the right to protest.
marcambinder	704494767019667456	2016-03-01T02:33:35	And frankly, the pressures of working the Mogul (Trump) Detail are unique. Still, some clarity would be good for press/protestors alike.
marcambinder	704494486815010816	2016-03-01T02:32:29	Finally, I recall that local police are often (almost always) the ones who remove protestors, along with earpiece-wearing campaign aides
marcambinder	704494273203298304	2016-03-01T02:31:38	I also know that dealing different campaigns and their demands can be impossible.

marcambinder	704493522645192704	2016-03-01T02:28:39	The SecretService operates as agents of his campaign, rather than as agents of our democracy. I trust their integrity but would like + info
marcambinder	704493201902608384	2016-03-01T02:27:22	There's always going to be different rules because the candidates and campaigns are different, but recent events create the perception that
marcambinder	704493085720334336	2016-03-01T02:26:55	I think the SecretService should clarify how they respond to campaign requests to restrict journalists to pens and to evict protestors.

marcambinder	704416332792483840	2016-02-29T21:21:55	In general, one shouldn't tell a SecretService agent on duty to f' off or ignore requests. Usually not a battle journalists need to fight.
