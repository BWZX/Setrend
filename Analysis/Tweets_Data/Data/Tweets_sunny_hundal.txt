sunny_hundal	726064011029143552	2016-04-29T15:02:04	shashj yeah I agree with that, I didn't like that much either. Just saying that globalisation has hurt working class badly too.
sunny_hundal	726063571801661440	2016-04-29T15:00:19	By that, I mean Labour have always felt spectacularly unprepared for Tory attacks in the final legs of most campaigns. Same for London.
sunny_hundal	726062725143650304	2016-04-29T14:56:57	With less than a week to go, the Tories are going to launch a ferocious assault on SadiqKhan. Can he drive the agenda instead? Not hopeful.

sunny_hundal	726060528519532544	2016-04-29T14:48:14	IanDunt btw, attacks on free speech have always been greater from the govt and media than a band of students. Even now

sunny_hundal	726053450509914112	2016-04-29T14:20:06	IanDunt ..pioneered by minorities, but by white people on the left and right. After all, class politics is ALSO ID politics my friend!
sunny_hundal	726053336244469761	2016-04-29T14:19:39	IanDunt I'm aware of the recent no-platforming controversies, I'm just saying they're part of a long tradition of ID politics which wasn't
sunny_hundal	726053014075793408	2016-04-29T14:18:22	FreeRadz3300 nina_mrs_mummy yes, I took a consistent position then, and now. You haven't shown otherwise.
sunny_hundal	726046101464338433	2016-04-29T13:50:54	FreeRadz3300 nina_mrs_mummy I asked where *I* had been hypocritical, as both of you accused me of
sunny_hundal	726046017871839233	2016-04-29T13:50:34	FreeRadz3300 nina_mrs_mummy I'm perfectly aware of other people's doub;t standards. Wrote this yesterday 
sunny_hundal	726045914259939328	2016-04-29T13:50:09	IanDunt Look at the generation of white Democrats who abandoned the party after Civil Rights Act. That's identity politics.
sunny_hundal	726045722345353217	2016-04-29T13:49:24	IanDunt ...given equal voting rights. That's my point here: this battle for rights is problematic for some only when minorities demand them
sunny_hundal	726045551498780672	2016-04-29T13:48:43	IanDunt right, so this battle wasn't started by minorities, but actually by whites who got pissed that blacks were freed from slavery or
sunny_hundal	726035740149338113	2016-04-29T13:09:44	IanDunt my point being, the incentive for claiming victim is there... But its not just minorities obsessed by ID politics who do that
sunny_hundal	726035543914610688	2016-04-29T13:08:57	IanDunt if that only applies to minorities, how do you explain Trump voters who think they're the worst off group of people in America?
sunny_hundal	725942240539906049	2016-04-29T06:58:12	We believe that Naz Shah is authentic in her apology. Ken Livingstone denies wrongdoing. This is not a one off. He can no longer be excused.
sunny_hundal	726031780525019136	2016-04-29T12:54:00	IanDunt the racism = prejudice + power construct is more trickier to unpack, and I agree it can be problematic. But power can't be ignored
sunny_hundal	726031444557058048	2016-04-29T12:52:40	IanDunt ..white people are sometimes guilty of using cultural or religious symbols without a care. Can't stop ppl getting angry for that
sunny_hundal	726031141954834432	2016-04-29T12:51:27	IanDunt these aren't hard and fast rules. I think the cultural appropriation outrages are usually horseshit. But its also true that..
sunny_hundal	726030718556577793	2016-04-29T12:49:46	FreeRadz3300 nina_mrs_mummy that's it. Very simple. Good bye
sunny_hundal	726030646137741314	2016-04-29T12:49:29	FreeRadz3300 nina_mrs_mummy 1. People should have legal right to be offensive 2. If ppl are offensive they can be criticised / fired.
sunny_hundal	726029533858652160	2016-04-29T12:45:04	IanDunt in what way? Give me an example
sunny_hundal	726029455706210304	2016-04-29T12:44:45	IanDunt no, theylaim to stand against anti Semitism... Except when their own side is close to it. I call that hypocrisy
sunny_hundal	726028144310915072	2016-04-29T12:39:33	FreeRadz3300 nina_mrs_mummy no. Try reading what I wrote earlier and now. Don't just accuse me of hypocrisy without evidence
sunny_hundal	726027935765913601	2016-04-29T12:38:43	IanDunt you think Tories aren't hypocritical in dealing with antisemitism? I've just offered a clear example with Imran Khan. *shrugs*
sunny_hundal	726027689769984000	2016-04-29T12:37:44	IanDunt I agree it can look like sometimes different standards are being applied. But every bloody group is hypocritical. Who isn't?
sunny_hundal	726026770353410048	2016-04-29T12:34:05	nina_mrs_mummy free speech means defending the right for someone to say something without imprisonment. Ken isn't going to jail.
sunny_hundal	726026538739728384	2016-04-29T12:33:10	nina_mrs_mummy I've never questioned the right of people to be offended. You can check that. I question their demand for censorship.
sunny_hundal	726025837565337600	2016-04-29T12:30:23	IanDunt I've been fighting religious extremists from Asian communities for 20 years. Do you see me whining about ID politics? Why not?
sunny_hundal	726025598603243520	2016-04-29T12:29:26	IanDunt but there's no way around this. Class alone isn't enough, its part of ID politics. What Cohen hates is a more complicated world
sunny_hundal	726024531274555392	2016-04-29T12:25:11	On anti-Semitism &amp; free speech, the response of much of the Jewish community to Naz Shah was to call for more conversations, not less &gt;
sunny_hundal	726018460241780736	2016-04-29T12:01:04	nina_mrs_mummy one can accept something is offensive without accepting those people should be locked up/killed for saying it.
sunny_hundal	726017965603328000	2016-04-29T11:59:06	IanDunt I don't make *my* values dependent on others, but that's not the same as negotiating conflicts where people have different values.
sunny_hundal	726015032572653568	2016-04-29T11:47:27	IanDunt for liberals, some values are absolute. For conservatives, other values are absolute.... whether you're Asian or not.
sunny_hundal	726012911689322497	2016-04-29T11:39:01	IanDunt BTW, discussion of how inority groups deal with sectarianism is an important one, but one that's neither new nor insurmountable

sunny_hundal	725625736149753856	2016-04-28T10:00:31	shashj overall, I'd say minorities still more open to cack-handed left-wing outreach than the disdain most on right traditionally showed.

sunny_hundal	725624323080376321	2016-04-28T09:54:54	shashj counter-point is that left-wing candidates reached out at least to ethnic minorities, albeit in a sometimes cackhanded manner.

sunny_hundal	724982347926482946	2016-04-26T15:23:55	nomiackerman Indeed. It doesn't help when some in the media (again, not you) are very selective about their outrage though.

sunny_hundal	720570633990615040	2016-04-14T11:13:21	I question ZacGoldsmith's judgement about who his friends are. He needs to explain his links to extremists.

sunny_hundal	720527425021603840	2016-04-14T08:21:39	zainabob fair enough, I think labelling / generalising is wrong. But I don't see any problems in saying some views 'good', some 'bad'...
sunny_hundal	720525139067203584	2016-04-14T08:12:34	zainabob but some people are happy to quickly judge others, but not people of their own tribe. That's inconsistent.
sunny_hundal	720524943612637184	2016-04-14T08:11:47	zainabob Just that people (like yr parents) you may want others to understand with more nuance also applies to racist white grannies
sunny_hundal	720524289594822657	2016-04-14T08:09:11	zainabob Don't think anyone is saying 'unacceptable' - but put it another way. Would an EDL member be a 'good Briton' to you?
sunny_hundal	720523987642658817	2016-04-14T08:07:59	JohnRentoul (I think voters are asked to rank politicians in that poll, than pick one). That said - this is a 8pt drop for both Cam &amp; Bojo
sunny_hundal	720522358214238208	2016-04-14T08:01:31	zainabob ...are more accepted and welcome than others. I think that's reasonable.
sunny_hundal	720522285627633665	2016-04-14T08:01:14	zainabob I judge people by their views not background - I suspect most (though clearly not all) judge same way. That implies some views...
sunny_hundal	720522076247957505	2016-04-14T08:00:24	Fletcher_Hanks they don't "give money" - they run specific projects themselves
sunny_hundal	720520170859536384	2016-04-14T07:52:50	zainabob but the presence of 'good Muslims' negates that. I didn't say ALL Muslims were bad...
sunny_hundal	720518152652746753	2016-04-14T07:44:48	sunny_hundal And the same people who criticise UK's spend on aid frequently call for more support for Syrian refugees.
sunny_hundal	720518249599864833	2016-04-14T07:45:11	RedFxTrade that's more down to UK not spending enough on cancer here
sunny_hundal	720517647054553088	2016-04-14T07:42:48	sunny_hundal Totally agree. Plus the DFID_UK budget has just been cut by £700m. 
sunny_hundal	720517253662437376	2016-04-14T07:41:14	JohnRentoul I can see that, but I'm finding it difficult to imagine those Tories now trust Corbyn more on the subject...
sunny_hundal	720516291543613441	2016-04-14T07:37:25	JohnRentoul that poll was just two months ago!
sunny_hundal	720516030452404224	2016-04-14T07:36:22	This argument that UK's aid money is 'too much' and therefore being 'spent badly' is new, and such rubbish. radio4
sunny_hundal	720515571650011136	2016-04-14T07:34:33	JohnRentoul except that Cameron and Boris were way ahead of Corbyn not long ago 
sunny_hundal	720370178610094084	2016-04-13T21:56:49	On who to trust regarding the European Union: J. Corbyn: 28% B. Johnson: 26% D. Cameron: 21% N. Farage: 19% M. Gove: 12% (via YouGov)
sunny_hundal	720512461284208640	2016-04-14T07:22:11	zainabob so I'm right in criticising some Hindus on basis of beliefs, and embracing others, right? 
sunny_hundal	720501565296132097	2016-04-14T06:38:54	Most disappointing was Trevor Phillip’s tendency to twist facts to fit narrative rather than shaping narrative to fit facts of the poll 1/
sunny_hundal	720510579321016320	2016-04-14T07:14:43	zainabob but that's also done for other groups. Why, for example, should I not criticise / abhor hardline fundamentalist Hindus?
sunny_hundal	720389315067424768	2016-04-13T23:12:51	Erm, because there are good and bad Muslims like people of any religion or background?

sunny_hundal	719820772110397440	2016-04-12T09:33:40	MarinaKim_ I also put questions to Zac about the company HE keeps. Odd, he hasn't replied to my questions. Why don't you ask him?
sunny_hundal	719817738160644096	2016-04-12T09:21:37	MarinaKim_ you specifically said "Sadiq are being divisive by constantly focusing on his faith"

sunny_hundal	719816519358750720	2016-04-12T09:16:46	MarinaKim_ the only one focusing on faith are Zac and his campaign, not Sadiq

sunny_hundal	715158085631885312	2016-03-30T12:45:49	TomBlenkinsop Rosiecosy this I agree with. China aren't competing fairly.

sunny_hundal	715156331347505152	2016-03-30T12:38:51	TomBlenkinsop But is the industry sustainable in the long term? Even the Chinese are trying to cut down production. Is it worth saving?
sunny_hundal	715156021312925696	2016-03-30T12:37:37	richie26188 We should def plan to help communities, rather than throwing money at saving the industry, IMO

sunny_hundal	711640395478917120	2016-03-20T19:47:46	Moazzam_Begg you blame the west because you don't want to admit Muslim extremism mutated into ISIS over 30 years. You can't admit it.
sunny_hundal	711640143782924289	2016-03-20T19:46:46	Moazzam_Begg You think ISIS came out of nowhere? No. It came from the Taliban and it came from Hizb ut Tahrir and the hardline mullahs
sunny_hundal	711639753314197506	2016-03-20T19:45:13	Justiceisall Moazzam_Begg I'm sure it had nothing to do with wanting to use / grow jihadi groups to make trouble in India/Afghanistan

sunny_hundal	711638166608994305	2016-03-20T19:38:55	Justiceisall Moazzam_Begg yeah sure, its not like Pakistan ever created or funded terrorist groups for own reasons

sunny_hundal	711637535777267712	2016-03-20T19:36:24	Moazzam_Begg I'm sure it was evil westerners who made Hizb ut Tahrir to call for the Khilafah and your mate Asim Qureshi to encourage jihad
sunny_hundal	711637347398512641	2016-03-20T19:35:39	Moazzam_Begg Yes yes, I'm sure its all these evil westerners who are driving ISIS to justify sexual slavery of Yazidis.

sunny_hundal	711634792601755648	2016-03-20T19:25:30	Moazzam_Begg Of course you haven't - you'd rather not condemn fellow travellers who rail against human rights. That would be inconvenient

sunny_hundal	711632207815774209	2016-03-20T19:15:14	Moazzam_Begg You're a pathetic conspiracy monger parading himself as a human rights defender. Sooner people see through the facade, better
sunny_hundal	711631959257124865	2016-03-20T19:14:15	Moazzam_Begg hah! Now your defense of Haithal al Haddad and other nutjobs is that anyone who questions their views is colluding with govt
sunny_hundal	711631688242225152	2016-03-20T19:13:10	JayAsher3 Sure, but its not like there haven't been attacks on Corbyn from other factions over last 6 months. In that climate...
sunny_hundal	711620195362672640	2016-03-20T18:27:30	It's reasonable for Corbyn supporters to ask if a different Labour leader would have responded to Budget by attacking disability cuts IDS
sunny_hundal	711619758957961216	2016-03-20T18:25:46	Moazzam_Begg as if you would never question someone's committment to human rights if they'd previously endorsed George Bush. Don't try it
sunny_hundal	711619589440991233	2016-03-20T18:25:06	Moazzam_Begg you're hanging out with and legitimising people who are anti-human rights. Ridiculous for you to pretend that's OK.

sunny_hundal	710452962334793731	2016-03-17T13:09:20	I didn't even know there was a campaign for the Golden Temple to remain in Sikhs hangs... or the London Mayor had any say in it *face palm*

sunny_hundal	710452407726153729	2016-03-17T13:07:08	Jeez, ZacGoldsmith's leaflet for British Sikhs is even more patronising. These aren't even vaguely the top issues!

sunny_hundal	710440298330132481	2016-03-17T12:19:01	rameez_zafar those socio-economic norms come from a culture of segregation. The two aren't separate

sunny_hundal	710438459853381632	2016-03-17T12:11:42	rameez_zafar Yeah, and Islamic countries have major problems in how women are treated. This is my point - gender segregation is harmful.
sunny_hundal	710436862125547520	2016-03-17T12:05:21	ImaniAmrani But then argue it from that perspective. But also easier to argue its helpful at younger at, not at uni

sunny_hundal	710435497341018112	2016-03-17T11:59:56	ImaniAmrani sure, like I said I don't like any segregation. But you seem to be arguing its ok at uni because some do it at school.
sunny_hundal	710432105386348544	2016-03-17T11:46:27	ImaniAmrani because after puberty you should learn how to interact with the opposite sex, respectfully, not be shielded from them.
sunny_hundal	710430118729129984	2016-03-17T11:38:34	ImaniAmrani I think single-sex private schools are problematic too. But at uni level this is worse
sunny_hundal	710429633225879552	2016-03-17T11:36:38	Just because some students are allowed to be idiots doesn't mean others aren't allowed to criticise.

sunny_hundal	704342444968644612	2016-02-29T16:28:19	FatimaAnsari_ You complain that people have this caricature of Pakistanis being intolerant. Then... you defend that intolerance. Shabaash!
sunny_hundal	704342127841570816	2016-02-29T16:27:03	dj__error why, would there be less or more paedophilia in the church?

sunny_hundal	704334464026087424	2016-02-29T15:56:36	FatimaAnsari_ I know about him too - I read the Pakistani media too. But like I said, he isn't the only one deserving of merit in Pakistan
sunny_hundal	704328207567294464	2016-02-29T15:31:45	FatimaAnsari_ And Edhi is not the answer to every Pakistani who cannot take criticism and lashes out at people like Malala.
sunny_hundal	704328035470811140	2016-02-29T15:31:04	FatimaAnsari_ I keep hearing about Edhi in response, but let me say this. HE IS NOT THE ONLY PAKISTANI IN THE WORLD.
sunny_hundal	704325810040217600	2016-02-29T15:22:13	FatimaAnsari_ Its easy for people like you to blame west for "saviour complex" than accept that many Pakistanis cannot take self-criticism
sunny_hundal	704325654456770560	2016-02-29T15:21:36	FatimaAnsari_ and I would also criticise Indians who want to condemn anyone who raises issue of social ills in India.
sunny_hundal	704325544352075776	2016-02-29T15:21:10	FatimaAnsari_ Sorry but you also sound paranoid. I don't have a "white saviour complex" and I still think this is stupid.
sunny_hundal	704325392556015616	2016-02-29T15:20:33	FatimaAnsari_ Well, that's your generalisation. But the attitude of Pakistanis towards people like Malala and Obaid makes it much worse.
sunny_hundal	704321332444581888	2016-02-29T15:04:25	FatimaAnsari_ And it also gives the impression that Islam /Pakistan justifies these crimes. They are gaining that reputation by own actions
sunny_hundal	704321134133694464	2016-02-29T15:03:38	FatimaAnsari_ When Muslims themselves spend more time criticising Malala and Obaid, they make themselves look stupid in western eyes.

sunny_hundal	704316373783207936	2016-02-29T14:44:43	FatimaAnsari_ what does that have to do with honour killings?
sunny_hundal	704316025186217984	2016-02-29T14:43:20	FatimaAnsari_ People like Malala &amp; Chinoy are shining examples of brave &amp; progressive Pakistanis. But their biggest critics are Pakistanis
sunny_hundal	704315535387975681	2016-02-29T14:41:23	FatimaAnsari_ what values are you referring to?
sunny_hundal	704313898095214592	2016-02-29T14:34:53	FatimaAnsari_ they're controversial figures because some do not like self-criticism. And without self-criticism, no nation can progress

sunny_hundal	704308915354337281	2016-02-29T14:15:05	FatimaAnsari_ ...just criticise anyone who shows them in a negative light. That is the simple truth.
sunny_hundal	704308830814007296	2016-02-29T14:14:45	FatimaAnsari_ this is a silly argument. Malala didn't rush to the world first, and yet she wwas still condemned. Many Pakistanis willl...
sunny_hundal	704307983237431296	2016-02-29T14:11:23	FatimaAnsari_ But that is precisely the problem, They're protesting her than protesting honour killings.
sunny_hundal	704306163601555456	2016-02-29T14:04:09	FatimaAnsari_ So they're attacking the woman who is raising the issue, than asking why these things happen in Pakistan?
