Dannythefink	719960410129043456	2016-04-12T18:48:32	ps10006 docamandahilton soph_cash seem to be advancing the bizarre argument that it is unsafe not to have enough people in the week but
Dannythefink	719960272627245058	2016-04-12T18:47:59	ps10006 docamandahilton soph_cash In your point about shifting people from the week you fail to address the question of weekends. Docs

Dannythefink	719953019186585600	2016-04-12T18:19:10	ps10006 docamandahilton soph_cash is a net gain. Docs now make the bizarre argument that rotas in the week would be unsafe if there were

Dannythefink	719952590159613952	2016-04-12T18:17:28	ps10006 docamandahilton soph_cash It isn't expanding! That is a fundamental misconception. In so far as it might reduce coverage in the

Dannythefink	719915458594476032	2016-04-12T15:49:55	docamandahilton soph_cash current workload then spreading wouldn't make things less safe unless you feel the exact current spread is
Dannythefink	719915053789618176	2016-04-12T15:48:18	docamandahilton soph_cash I agree that if you add in more work and not add in more docs you will make things unsafe. But if you take the

Dannythefink	719787783896702977	2016-04-12T07:22:35	docamandahilton soph_cash a different point, which is that it is the new rostering of existing numbers that's less safe, and that I am
Dannythefink	719787588450709504	2016-04-12T07:21:48	docamandahilton soph_cash that we don't have a safe number of doctors, then I think there is a discussion to be had. But you are arguing

Dannythefink	719787085067128832	2016-04-12T07:19:48	docamandahilton soph_cash I grasp the pilot analogy, of course. The bit of your analogy that's missing is that unlike with planes, the

Dannythefink	719226653084397569	2016-04-10T18:12:51	soph_cash docamandahilton I can't - even in the most basic logic - see how it can make it less safe than the current position.
Dannythefink	719226505092558849	2016-04-10T18:12:16	soph_cash docamandahilton I think one can argue we currently need more docs, but not that spreading what we have makes things less safe.
Dannythefink	719226260245897217	2016-04-10T18:11:17	docamandahilton At the moment everyone is running at speed toward a brick wall
Dannythefink	719226108005261312	2016-04-10T18:10:41	docamandahilton docs. The problems are with overall situation. And I think we could get agreement if the BMA was willing to reach for one.
Dannythefink	719225898613018624	2016-04-10T18:09:51	docamandahilton I have ever argued is that I think it's a bit of a red herring. The changes aren't that big. In some ways it's better for
Dannythefink	719225728546549760	2016-04-10T18:09:10	docamandahilton other countries, of course but we do need to review overall conditions. However this strike is about the new contract. All
Dannythefink	719225519154339844	2016-04-10T18:08:20	docamandahilton That's very interesting. I do think the NHS has to consider the entire working pattern of docs. It isn't too dissimilar to

Dannythefink	719223996034727937	2016-04-10T18:02:17	docamandahilton Ok. Well that makes it hard to progress. But I'm grateful to you for taking it further. I'm sad you aren't taking on your

Dannythefink	719223366905958400	2016-04-10T17:59:47	docamandahilton obvious why safety was a concern, but I don't find the case persuasive. I haven't ever had anyone explain logically why
Dannythefink	719223031667781633	2016-04-10T17:58:27	docamandahilton No. I just haven't found the doctors case persuasive on safety and I've spoken to many many doctors who agree. It's

Dannythefink	719222570235596800	2016-04-10T17:56:37	docamandahilton Ok. That's progress because we know what we are discussing now. What would this extra money pay for. More doctors? Or more
Dannythefink	719222263824969729	2016-04-10T17:55:24	docamandahilton I understand.
Dannythefink	719221976347328512	2016-04-10T17:54:16	docamandahilton Yes.
Dannythefink	719221864967626753	2016-04-10T17:53:49	docamandahilton can't see what the alternative is. I don't know what you would all settle for.
Dannythefink	719221728577220608	2016-04-10T17:53:17	docamandahilton I do worry about imposition (although 70 per cent won't leave, of course, there may well be a significant number). But I

Dannythefink	719221224254124033	2016-04-10T17:51:17	docamandahilton would ask is that you accept there is a counter case even if you don't agree it is made.

Dannythefink	719217438244630531	2016-04-10T17:36:14	OrthopodReg such a vast difference. I think after it comes in you will all wonder what the fuss was.

Dannythefink	719216767831252994	2016-04-10T17:33:34	docamandahilton we differ? It's so depressing that any attempt to engage meets this kind of ad hominem response.
Dannythefink	719216528965636098	2016-04-10T17:32:37	docamandahilton you all so difficult. Can't we just have a conversation like adults. Friendly, limited in duration, willing to accept that
Dannythefink	719216311927238662	2016-04-10T17:31:45	docamandahilton It's ludicrous to suggest that in any way I posed as knowing more about medicine than her. This is what makes arguing with

Dannythefink	719137960545935360	2016-04-10T12:20:25	burnikov to fail to accept the point in which e both might politely disengage. I hope you can see this even if you feel my overall view
Dannythefink	719137778722848768	2016-04-10T12:19:42	burnikov But in fact there are many many docs, and only one me replying. I'm trying my best but it is hardly an act of courage on her part

Dannythefink	719136609648644096	2016-04-10T12:15:03	drkennethma no, it's just I can't go on arguing with one person forever. It doesn't mean I'm right or wrong.
Dannythefink	719136366026747904	2016-04-10T12:14:05	OrthopodReg generally suggesting docs should shut up.
Dannythefink	719136269889114112	2016-04-10T12:13:42	OrthopodReg it wasn't too bad to try desperately to end a single exchange with one individual. I wouldn't want you to feel I was more

Dannythefink	719135802802970624	2016-04-10T12:11:50	OrthopodReg I don't mean you to at all. I am happy to answer and engage with docs, and have done so. This was a very specific point to one
Dannythefink	719096899706494977	2016-04-10T09:37:15	drumtwit problems but I think the contract is a bit of a red herring.

Dannythefink	719094760963760128	2016-04-10T09:28:45	drumtwit I did try. And in the end I was a bit rude, but I did try not be personal.

Dannythefink	719094398701682689	2016-04-10T09:27:19	drumtwit that I felt she was like someone who buttonholes you and then won't stop whatever you do. I did, before sending that to her

Dannythefink	719094066273775616	2016-04-10T09:26:00	drumtwit And in my defence (if I may) it came because months of trying to answer still met with her saying I wouldn't answer questions. I

Dannythefink	715316193524072448	2016-03-30T23:14:05	ajmcpartlin bendean1979 this was demonstrated by the fact that negotiations took place because the conditions were not preconditions.

Dannythefink	715251379921674240	2016-03-30T18:56:32	bendean1979 It was his reading but clearly wrong as preconditions means conditions before negotiation. And there were negotiations.

Dannythefink	710168309375868929	2016-03-16T18:18:13	FraserNelson Very good. See you soon. All the best.
Dannythefink	710168184360452096	2016-03-16T18:17:44	FraserNelson But if people disagree once they've read the full thing that's fine. The OBR take no position but he said that.

Dannythefink	710167073096339457	2016-03-16T18:13:19	FraserNelson I don't agree that he did or that he should have left it out. I think it was quite careful what he said.
Dannythefink	710165996972154880	2016-03-16T18:09:02	FraserNelson He may be wrong but naturally he thinks there would be an economic impact. It would be absurd not to say that.
Dannythefink	710165760157548544	2016-03-16T18:08:06	FraserNelson I'm sorry Fraser but he didn't enroll the OBR against Brexit. He said they correctly had no view. He gave his own view.

Dannythefink	709023892128530432	2016-03-13T14:30:43	drgprman ashevans9 Jeremy_Hunt First, there is no need to explain the contract to me, simply or otherwise. Your odd idea is that the only

Dannythefink	708980519162286081	2016-03-13T11:38:22	drgprman ashevans9 the government was introducing the new contract to save money. Now you make an entirely separate point about the pay
Dannythefink	708980328237498368	2016-03-13T11:37:37	drgprman ashevans9 No, that's deliberately twisting my words. I said I thought you were asking for more money or fewer hours. I didn't say

Dannythefink	708323683887136769	2016-03-11T16:08:20	ashevans9 You mr point about no analysis that it is safe is so preposterous it hardly merits an answer. There is comprehensively no reason
Dannythefink	708323455113019392	2016-03-11T16:07:26	ashevans9 It's quite convenient that your own objective opinion is that you should all be paid more. And you think you are the best judge.

Dannythefink	708270416301854720	2016-03-11T12:36:40	ashevans9 The threat of imposition is essential and probably the reality. No one gets to decide their terms and conditions themselves. You
Dannythefink	708270049535115264	2016-03-11T12:35:13	ashevans9 and I do wish you luck with your medical studies and career.
Dannythefink	708269916315631616	2016-03-11T12:34:41	ashevans9 I totally oppose it. I don't think we can go much further and I understand you equally strongly disagree. I am sorry about that
Dannythefink	708269685830262784	2016-03-11T12:33:46	ashevans9 it isn't unsafe or unfair in any way. You are using your muscle and public confidence to try and get your way and I see why. But

Dannythefink	708269358632603648	2016-03-11T12:32:28	ashevans9 because you doctors are so furiously incapable - as I have discovered - of accepting that someone might reasonably disagree with
Dannythefink	708269168202747904	2016-03-11T12:31:43	ashevans9 On a careful study of the possible implications which cannot be in any logical sense unsafe. He is only facing those calls
Dannythefink	708263459675308033	2016-03-11T12:09:02	ashevans9 There is also no logical reason to regard the new system as less safe. But we could try a five year trial.
Dannythefink	708262137534259200	2016-03-11T12:03:47	ashevans9 The medical director of the NHS is satisfied that the contract is safe. That seems quite a strong basis for the SoS to proceed.
Dannythefink	708261793240633344	2016-03-11T12:02:25	ashevans9 acceptable? Is there a deal to be done? I don't think so?
Dannythefink	708261671157030914	2016-03-11T12:01:55	ashevans9 I do understand and worry very much about morale, but I'm not certain I know what to do. What further concession would be

Dannythefink	708261149758898176	2016-03-11T11:59:51	ashevans9 Thank you. The government aren't stonewalling, they are disagreeing with the doctors' position. They are arguing that the new
Dannythefink	708256846126170117	2016-03-11T11:42:45	ashevans9 to preserve the status quo against the change. And that makes no sense.
Dannythefink	708256750361812992	2016-03-11T11:42:22	ashevans9 bad one? There is none. If you were on strike for more doctors, I would understand MUCH better but you aren't. You are striking
Dannythefink	708256549588901893	2016-03-11T11:41:34	ashevans9 week versus the marginal increase in weekends. This is using your own argument. Now what evidence is there that this trade is a

Dannythefink	704606504519921664	2016-03-01T09:57:36	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt ignored. Yet at the same time it robs you of distance. You can see that with me, so surely you must see
Dannythefink	704606317521051648	2016-03-01T09:56:51	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt objective. So I do accept that your experience and values brings a great deal to this that must not be
Dannythefink	704606131902136321	2016-03-01T09:56:07	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt absurd to think I can abstract myself from them. But then you can't see your own! You? You are
Dannythefink	704605897868316672	2016-03-01T09:55:11	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt not me and you see me from outside. You correctly appreciate my interests and rightly regard it as
Dannythefink	704605753152282629	2016-03-01T09:54:37	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt Of course. I naturally have my own self interest. But you can see that clearly you see because you are

Dannythefink	704564231371366400	2016-03-01T07:09:37	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt deliberate confusion but it is quite powerful. So while I acknowledge the insight you bring, I am
Dannythefink	704563791300829184	2016-03-01T07:07:52	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt from the general interest. We are all bound pretty much to imagine them the same. That isn't a
Dannythefink	704563535951601664	2016-03-01T07:06:51	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt self-interest is bound up in the outcome. And none of us are perfect at separating our own interest
Dannythefink	704563331512836096	2016-03-01T07:06:03	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt with insights I don't have. I accept that. I would only gently say that your experience means your own

Dannythefink	704438468043218944	2016-02-29T22:49:53	amibanerjee1 dannymcg Jeremy_Hunt there comes a point where you have to come to terms. You won't and that's not reasonable.

Dannythefink	704324634439712768	2016-02-29T15:17:33	MarkdTheo and (honestly, truly, deeply) I just don't think it is. When will you ever settle? Do you think it is possible that you've got so

Dannythefink	704324255228534784	2016-02-29T15:16:02	MarkdTheo Naturally I accept your interest in safety. I know doctors care deeply about their patients. But I just think the case on safety

Dannythefink	704321134368591872	2016-02-29T15:03:38	MarkdTheo argue if all you say is that it isn't safe? I'm afraid you use that argument because it is the one thing that makes your self
Dannythefink	704320988117340160	2016-02-29T15:03:03	MarkdTheo The thing is on safety, there is literally NO evidence it would be unsafe. I think it would actually be safer! So how can anyone

Dannythefink	704320304735260672	2016-02-29T15:00:20	MarkdTheo I do, of course I do. But honestly while I felt you had the right to push hard in negotiations, you did that. You got lots of

Dannythefink	689893061250437120	2016-01-20T19:31:38	ASO1664 DPJHodges I was quite surprised and disappointed
Dannythefink	689891562550091779	2016-01-20T19:25:40	child_nick I have answered by the way
Dannythefink	689891269724758016	2016-01-20T19:24:30	child_nick Whatever you want to think.
Dannythefink	689889925391597568	2016-01-20T19:19:10	child_nick Yep just as I thought.
Dannythefink	689889236158390272	2016-01-20T19:16:26	child_nick no one ever ever admits it wasn't a good idea to tweet something and I'm sure you'll just keep going but frankly it's absurd.
Dannythefink	689889050560479232	2016-01-20T19:15:41	child_nick But honestly why are you on Twitter defending something you haven't read! How do you know you even want to defend it.
Dannythefink	689888850748035072	2016-01-20T19:14:54	child_nick It is entirely unilluminating about the media, but not necessarily dishonest. The material in Ed Miliband is dishonest.
Dannythefink	689888295258591232	2016-01-20T19:12:41	child_nick Literally nobody who has actually read the report has taken issue with my description of it because my conclusion is inescapable
Dannythefink	689887802071318528	2016-01-20T19:10:44	child_nick necessarily dishonest. The treatment of the role of Ed Miliband in the defeat is both cowardly and dishonest.
Dannythefink	689887590862995456	2016-01-20T19:09:53	child_nick if you'd read it, it would be entirely obvious. But ok, while there are many bits of thin platitudinous analysis these aren't

Dannythefink	689882776351416320	2016-01-20T18:50:45	child_nick I just don't accept that you can express a view on whether it was appropriate without reading the report. And why would you
Dannythefink	689879659299934209	2016-01-20T18:38:22	child_nick issue with me, or engage me at upon it, before you've read it? When you have you might agree! I am a bit bemused.
Dannythefink	689879478273720320	2016-01-20T18:37:39	child_nick How can you decide whether my view is reasonable or proportionate without reading the Report? Why would you wish to take
Dannythefink	689879273621032961	2016-01-20T18:36:50	child_nick I wasn't quick to condemn. I read it carefully, thought about it and deemed it worthy of condemnation.
Dannythefink	689878995299598337	2016-01-20T18:35:44	child_nick view.
Dannythefink	689874759362990080	2016-01-20T18:18:54	child_nick thin is, in my opinion, a disgraceful way to treat the party. I feel you might concur if you read it. I think it's a common
Dannythefink	689874478365609984	2016-01-20T18:17:47	child_nick It's an intellectual disgrace. To be entrusted with something so important and to submit something so obviously dishonest and
Dannythefink	689867731097772033	2016-01-20T17:50:58	@steffanjohn david_colquhoun It's really quite an odd criticism. It was a harsh (but fair) judgment on a document not abusive of a person.
Dannythefink	689865163080646661	2016-01-20T17:40:46	david_colquhoun know what it was about and thus whether it was proportionate.
Dannythefink	689865011372638208	2016-01-20T17:40:10	david_colquhoun I am baffled. I regard your complaint as preposterous. You can't know if my tweet was appropriate because you don't
Dannythefink	689864163389263876	2016-01-20T17:36:48	tissington david_colquhoun Very irritating.
Dannythefink	689854021218222081	2016-01-20T16:56:30	michaelsavage Ah! Sorry thought it was an urban slang response to the Beckett tweet! I think the CTF number will include huge survey costs.

Dannythefink	689853659564396544	2016-01-20T16:55:03	david_colquhoun Ok. Well that's ironic. Because do you know what I think spoils Twitter? People commenting on things they haven't read

Dannythefink	689853162904252420	2016-01-20T16:53:05	michaelsavage (?) sorry.
Dannythefink	689853046680096769	2016-01-20T16:52:37	david_colquhoun It does. But I think this is a reasonable response. Have you read it? It's really bad.

Dannythefink	684450735782817793	2016-01-05T19:05:46	MatthewRavenhil DFosterEvans in what way? Just because we say it does?
Dannythefink	684450585354055680	2016-01-05T19:05:10	andrewtathampi2 No.
Dannythefink	684450519646076928	2016-01-05T19:04:55	DFosterEvans Yes it is split and the leader has to manage it.
Dannythefink	684450209439547392	2016-01-05T19:03:41	crishawes Why?
Dannythefink	684450064241156096	2016-01-05T19:03:06	trissyboi rob_francis Because members of the SC will clearly have views and negotiations are required. What's the problem with that?
Dannythefink	684449836754702336	2016-01-05T19:02:12	SirBasilBrush Ideally I'm sure they would but once you get going everyone is bound to know.
Dannythefink	684449570517041157	2016-01-05T19:01:08	jimmynthompson Well we don't know that but she is still in the SC.

Dannythefink	684449304673673218	2016-01-05T19:00:05	DFosterEvans ok. It's what Wilson did. I think it was sensible but I hear you.
Dannythefink	684449051673247744	2016-01-05T18:59:05	MarcOxford the difference with what?
Dannythefink	684448944005369857	2016-01-05T18:58:39	TheJoJohnson17 xtophercook I'm sorry you think we are vile.
Dannythefink	684448759045042177	2016-01-05T18:57:55	DFosterEvans The cabinet will have a view, but this is politics and politics is chemistry not physics.
Dannythefink	684448444950429696	2016-01-05T18:56:40	adamboultonSKY Genuinely not. I just trying to look at it from one pace back.
Dannythefink	684448252612194304	2016-01-05T18:55:54	rob_francis I don't think they killed all that much really.
Dannythefink	684448071535714304	2016-01-05T18:55:11	tommy_toolman Don't think most people are watching.
Dannythefink	684447942892208128	2016-01-05T18:54:40	rob_francis Because others are interacting with it, saying yes and no to things. It's politics.
Dannythefink	684447714201989123	2016-01-05T18:53:46	_GeorgeRoberts I think he isn't really but this doesn't mean by itself that he is wrong.

Dannythefink	684447353210814464	2016-01-05T18:52:20	helspence correct.
Dannythefink	684447284227096576	2016-01-05T18:52:03	jatrius Well I don't think it will make much difference over a couple of days really.
Dannythefink	684447069591998464	2016-01-05T18:51:12	DFosterEvans I think it would be bonkers to insist on that.

Dannythefink	684446771452493824	2016-01-05T18:50:01	jimmynthompson of course he knows.
Dannythefink	684446694331822080	2016-01-05T18:49:42	PaddyBriggs I don't agree.
Dannythefink	684446553751334913	2016-01-05T18:49:09	rob_francis Not a big deal really.
Dannythefink	684446431093125120	2016-01-05T18:48:40	DFosterEvans Why?
Dannythefink	684446320862560257	2016-01-05T18:48:13	alpha_beatt correct
Dannythefink	684446260670148610	2016-01-05T18:47:59	rob_francis why?
Dannythefink	684446117304647680	2016-01-05T18:47:25	E. If Mike Dugher is going to say whatever he wants on the backbenches isn't that better than (as he has) doing it in the frontbenches.
Dannythefink	684445789066792960	2016-01-05T18:46:07	Then D. If one of his colleagues says something that makes him change his plans why shouldn't he? His plans will then be better.
Dannythefink	684445322211389440	2016-01-05T18:44:15	C. If it takes him a day or two to work this all out with colleagues what's the problem? Doesn't that happen in most organisations.
Dannythefink	684445095970664450	2016-01-05T18:43:21	B. Isn't it reasonable to insist on some basic collective responsibility.
Dannythefink	684444950604460033	2016-01-05T18:42:47	A. Why does it matter how long Jeremy Corbyn takes reshuffling?
Dannythefink	684438681260814337	2016-01-05T18:17:52	SteveNickSmith peterjukes Well yes that's slightly my point.

Dannythefink	684409276220182528	2016-01-05T16:21:01	SteveNickSmith peterjukes Yes the same laws apply but the cases are different. Critically Corbyn relies on the membership and not on the
Dannythefink	684406307558961152	2016-01-05T16:09:14	SteveNickSmith peterjukes Not publicly though. I think you are right about broad support but Corbyn's position is very different.

Dannythefink	684404369681420292	2016-01-05T16:01:32	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika Well, ok. That's what we are disagreeing about. I think it's gone beyond the situation Thatcher
Dannythefink	684404172414971908	2016-01-05T16:00:44	Shaker_Chizzle peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika Exactly! Precisely my point!
Dannythefink	684404007511654400	2016-01-05T16:00:05	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika But he needs to be in control and not look weak.
Dannythefink	684403939572355072	2016-01-05T15:59:49	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika trying to work through his own strategy. He does have to keep, you are right, a balance of some sort.
Dannythefink	684403780830531584	2016-01-05T15:59:11	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika you ask me the best course of action to help Labour win it would be to resign! So what I am doing is
Dannythefink	684403651666907136	2016-01-05T15:58:40	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika when analyzing things from Corbyn's point of view you have to try to see the world as he sees it. If

Dannythefink	684400065264402432	2016-01-05T15:44:25	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika and quite a few off the record. But none on the record straight disagreement.

Dannythefink	684399565324288000	2016-01-05T15:42:26	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika What has been done to Corbyn is unprecedented.
Dannythefink	684399456981270528	2016-01-05T15:42:00	peterjukes nytamann ayeshahazarika That's exactly what I mean. He dissented privately but didn't do on the record opposition.

Dannythefink	684329464419991552	2016-01-05T11:03:53	footymac answer is no, certainly not.
Dannythefink	684329380940767234	2016-01-05T11:03:33	footymac The right question is should he appoint as foreign secretary someone who utterly disagrees with his EU policy. And clearly the
