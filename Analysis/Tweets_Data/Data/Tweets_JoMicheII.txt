JoMicheII	721001644159340545	2016-04-15T15:46:02	RajaKorman TheStalwart I find the whole thing a bit far-fetched to be honest. Seems to collapse into a sort of truism.
JoMicheII	721001546285244416	2016-04-15T15:45:38	RajaKorman TheStalwart Yes, but that would require some sort of market imperfection to produce the mispricing.

JoMicheII	721000195190874113	2016-04-15T15:40:16	RajaKorman TheStalwart Not sure. Would depend if you thought the current real rate of interest faced by firms was 'wrong' rate.

JoMicheII	720998903957610496	2016-04-15T15:35:08	TheStalwart My reading:  1) the long-run real rate of interest is exogenous.  2) nominal rate = real rate + inflation.

JoMicheII	720881815880212484	2016-04-15T07:49:52	Gilesyb tylercowen MacRoweNick t0nyyates You can't just take the first derivative of each side of the old AD curve to get the new one.
JoMicheII	720881701224722432	2016-04-15T07:49:25	Gilesyb tylercowen MacRoweNick t0nyyates OK. But as I said, the Cowen dynamic AS-AD system is a different model altogether.

JoMicheII	720881131214639108	2016-04-15T07:47:09	Gilesyb tylercowen MacRoweNick t0nyyates No. The fixed nominal spending thing is a complete red herring. It's not in there.

JoMicheII	720880548437078017	2016-04-15T07:44:50	Gilesyb tylercowen MacRoweNick t0nyyates No. Not the same amount of spending. It's about *stocks* of money specifically.
JoMicheII	720880431604740096	2016-04-15T07:44:22	Gilesyb I think you've rather reinforced my original point that the model is very confusing and misleading and should not be taught!
JoMicheII	720880143699304448	2016-04-15T07:43:14	Gilesyb The new 'dynamic' model captures the relationship in a Woodford-type 'New Neoclassical Synthesis' DSGE model.
JoMicheII	720880048018829312	2016-04-15T07:42:51	Gilesyb Why? Because lower prices increases the 'value' of the money supply. Derived from output-prices interaction in an IS-LM system.
JoMicheII	720879722868056066	2016-04-15T07:41:33	Gilesyb In old static model, AD curve is behavioural relationship between price and output. As price falls, output increases. NGDP varies.
JoMicheII	720879540105404416	2016-04-15T07:40:50	Gilesyb Likewise you can't derive the AD curve by shifting the AS curve around. AD tells you where new equilirbm will be if AS does shift.
JoMicheII	720879393694830593	2016-04-15T07:40:15	Gilesyb First, your assumption that AD is derived by holding NGDP fixed is wrong. That would produce rectangular parabolas.

JoMicheII	720878473791676417	2016-04-15T07:36:36	Gilesyb tylercowen MacRoweNick DavidBeckworth t0nyyates I've told you why. In the old model it is due to real balance effects.
JoMicheII	720877917505396736	2016-04-15T07:34:23	Gilesyb tylercowen No, they aren't. That's your key mistake.

JoMicheII	720735309613371393	2016-04-14T22:07:43	Gilesyb Your pictures are of the 'dynamic' AS-AD model, with inflation on Y-axis. I am talking about the old static model, p lvl on Y-axis.
JoMicheII	720734509050806273	2016-04-14T22:04:32	Gilesyb If AS shifts out, p falls. AD tells you demand at new level of p. Because AD slopes down, lower p leads to higher Y. But why?
JoMicheII	720734015095980032	2016-04-14T22:02:34	Gilesyb dave_chivers AD curve isn't constructed by assuming NGDP constant. NGDP will vary along the curve.

JoMicheII	720699583278489603	2016-04-14T19:45:45	GavinHJackson But that makes it difficult for students.
JoMicheII	720699486486544385	2016-04-14T19:45:22	GavinHJackson That's reasonable. But I wouldn't want to select only one to start from. Would present two or three to show alternatives.
JoMicheII	720698769466138624	2016-04-14T19:42:31	GavinHJackson I genuinely don't think there is any basic framework out there which relaly works. Others will disagree strongly though.
JoMicheII	720698505313038337	2016-04-14T19:41:28	GavinHJackson I'm still not happy with my basic mental model. I reckon it can explain about 60% of what I see in the data at best.
JoMicheII	720698245245202434	2016-04-14T19:40:26	GavinHJackson And why it implies an inverse relationship between output and interest rates.
JoMicheII	720698164693639170	2016-04-14T19:40:07	GavinHJackson Yes, most first years probably do it  I suspect. I doubt many could really explain what goods market equilibrium means.
JoMicheII	720697801634660352	2016-04-14T19:38:40	GavinHJackson I think even IS-LM is too difficult. It's actually quite a complex model. Requires quite a lot to understand it properly.
JoMicheII	720697666041167872	2016-04-14T19:38:08	GavinHJackson I wouldn't want to show students any *one* model and say 'this is a simple version of the full picture, details later'.
JoMicheII	720697313098919940	2016-04-14T19:36:44	GavinHJackson There really isn't any simple 2x2 model that captures enough of the complexity, IMO.

JoMicheII	720696726672306177	2016-04-14T19:34:24	Gilesyb dave_chivers No. The curves are two supposedly independent relationships. Equilbrium is the point of intersection between them.
JoMicheII	720688110485520385	2016-04-14T19:00:09	Gilesyb dave_chivers Actually slope point is wrong. NGDP=constant implies a hyperbola. But AD is usually drawn as a linear relationship.
JoMicheII	720686857978322944	2016-04-14T18:55:11	Gilesyb dave_chivers Depending on strength of this relationship, NGDP may rise or fall with a move along the curve.
JoMicheII	720686635562766340	2016-04-14T18:54:18	Gilesyb dave_chivers It is a causal relationship which says as price falls, real demand increases.
JoMicheII	720686305789767683	2016-04-14T18:52:59	Gilesyb dave_chivers True that there exists a slope at which NGDP will remain constant along curve. But that is not how curve is defined.

JoMicheII	720639790941671424	2016-04-14T15:48:09	dave_chivers But that's the reason not to teach it! It is nothing like the micro case. This is the source of the confusion.
JoMicheII	720639056800034816	2016-04-14T15:45:14	dave_chivers ... this is complicated. Don't expect to be able to grasp it straight away or to get a simple answer.
JoMicheII	720638933093232640	2016-04-14T15:44:45	dave_chivers Yes. I have't taught straight macro for a while so not sure how I would approach it now. I think i would start with ...
JoMicheII	720626512182001664	2016-04-14T14:55:23	dave_chivers Come on, that's completely different! What justification is there for telling students if -ve relationship tween price and AD?
JoMicheII	720626216982691840	2016-04-14T14:54:13	So let's stop pretending that monetary policy is somehow distinct from fiscal policy. 
JoMicheII	720625840342593536	2016-04-14T14:52:43	dave_chivers I had opposite experience. I wanted to know why AD sloped down and got more and more confused trying to find out why!
JoMicheII	720625474582552576	2016-04-14T14:51:16	dave_chivers Agree. I think the apparently simplicity of AS-AD is the danger. The mechanism underneath isn't simple. IS-LM appears complex.
JoMicheII	720624513537482752	2016-04-14T14:47:27	dave_chivers I think IS-LM less dangerous because it doesn't look like Marshallian partial equilibrium. At least not P and Q on axes.
JoMicheII	720624265033302016	2016-04-14T14:46:27	dave_chivers Well, I think students should see eg IS-LM. But is trying to capture something else. So, yes to graphs but no to 'one graph'.
JoMicheII	720621784811380737	2016-04-14T14:36:36	dave_chivers If not, it says higher real wages will increase demand.
JoMicheII	720621624664440832	2016-04-14T14:35:58	dave_chivers Does the 'price level' include wages? If so, diagram says deflation will increase demand?
JoMicheII	720621237706301440	2016-04-14T14:34:26	dave_chivers If it had a horizontal AD curve, I think it might *just* be admissable as a first step.
JoMicheII	720620890942255104	2016-04-14T14:33:03	dave_chivers It's dangerous because it looks like a standard partial equilibrium micro graph - but is nothing of the sort.
JoMicheII	720620750433087488	2016-04-14T14:32:30	dave_chivers My point about the AD curve is important. Is there any evidence for a negative relationship between price level and AD? No.
JoMicheII	720620546464083968	2016-04-14T14:31:41	dave_chivers The argument 'this may be fundamentally flawed but come up with a better one' isn't strong. If it's broken, don't use it.

JoMicheII	720617779557228544	2016-04-14T14:20:41	dave_chivers Well. Why is the AD curve downward-sloping, for example?
JoMicheII	720617511285309440	2016-04-14T14:19:37	georgepearkes GavinHJackson Yes, settlement question. What are options for settlement - reserves or demand deposits?

JoMicheII	720568154699788288	2016-04-14T11:03:30	t0nyyates toby_n tomashirstecon Yes, but other factors may overwhelm relationship tween r*  and TFP so possibly/proably no.
JoMicheII	720566773238657024	2016-04-14T10:58:00	t0nyyates toby_n tomashirstecon Indeed. Also semi-agree that in the long-run structural factors (i.e. incomes) will intercede.
JoMicheII	720565918007472128	2016-04-14T10:54:36	t0nyyates toby_n tomashirstecon Dissapointed. Was at least expecting something on interaction 'tween credit frictions and lag structures.
JoMicheII	720565015389069312	2016-04-14T10:51:01	t0nyyates toby_n tomashirstecon So why did we get simultanous revival of housing market and collapes of productivity circa 2010?
JoMicheII	720564738556588032	2016-04-14T10:49:55	tomashirstecon I increasingly think it is supply-side too. If wages rose, there would be an incentive for firms to save on labour.
JoMicheII	720562873609662465	2016-04-14T10:42:31	tomashirstecon Is the problem difficulty in increasing productiviy or no incentive to do so because of cheap labour? I suspect latter.
JoMicheII	720562254962421760	2016-04-14T10:40:03	tomashirstecon If 'solution' to low wages/productivity and AD shortfall is provision of consumer credit through mortgage lending, then yes.

JoMicheII	715487532465594368	2016-03-31T10:34:55	tomashirstecon That would require a turnaround in primary income and big pick-up in services exports. Plausible, but I wouldn't bet on it.

JoMicheII	715484932714332161	2016-03-31T10:24:35	tomashirstecon I'll turn it around - looking at this graph, why would you expect it to go back to zero? 
JoMicheII	715484589502763009	2016-03-31T10:23:13	drlangtry_girl MissEllieMae Reading between the lines after latest projections, Chote basically said he didn't believe them.
JoMicheII	715483688792772609	2016-03-31T10:19:39	MissEllieMae They are certainly on a bit of a run at the moment.
JoMicheII	715482617903075328	2016-03-31T10:15:23	MissEllieMae The problem isn't confined to the OBR. IMF are just as bad, for example.
JoMicheII	715482508536586240	2016-03-31T10:14:57	MissEllieMae I don't think they are politicised. I think they are using a very standard macro model which produces implausible projections.
JoMicheII	715482291640774656	2016-03-31T10:14:06	MissEllieMae But it's a reflection of deeper problems in academic macroeconomics. The models just aren't very good.
JoMicheII	715482047620390912	2016-03-31T10:13:07	MissEllieMae They rely on a unrealistic macro model, which they feed implausible assumptions. Good summary here: 
JoMicheII	715480414849138689	2016-03-31T10:06:38	tomashirstecon Even if the CA deficit closes to ~= 3%, i.e. primary income deficit closes significantly, I still see problems.
JoMicheII	715479862547353602	2016-03-31T10:04:26	tomashirstecon Also haven't seen any really good analysis of what's going on with the primary income account.
JoMicheII	715479735250194432	2016-03-31T10:03:56	tomashirstecon I'd go for 'worry, but don't panic'. :)
JoMicheII	715479570569252864	2016-03-31T10:03:17	tomashirstecon That's a really important question. I also see no immediate reason to think it's a permanent shift.
JoMicheII	715479387101995008	2016-03-31T10:02:33	tomashirstecon Perhaps. But there are some influential voices in the 'don't worry' camp.

JoMicheII	708229260218134529	2016-03-11T09:53:08	AbiWilks Yesterday's announcement is very different from Osborne fiscal charter. Doesn't commit to balancing the books - investment exempt.
JoMicheII	708228899600207872	2016-03-11T09:51:42	AbiWilks But overall, given the constraints, I think it's decent proposal. It will attract much wider support than previous announcements.
JoMicheII	708228708553920512	2016-03-11T09:50:57	AbiWilks I have reservations that the rule is overly restrictive, as outlined in response to earlier statement here

JoMicheII	708041968211857408	2016-03-10T21:28:54	DuncanWeldon Perhaps. But maybe not if they come with a serious commitment to spend on investment.

JoMicheII	706862732113539072	2016-03-07T15:23:02	DuncanWeldon  
JoMicheII	706861061148975104	2016-03-07T15:16:24	DuncanWeldon The corellation in that graph is very interesting but the claimed chain of causation sounds tenuous to me.
JoMicheII	706860903279542272	2016-03-07T15:15:46	DuncanWeldon It's amazing how often Ireland is the outlier in cross-country comparisons. I find myself subconsciously discounting it.

JoMicheII	706859685362733057	2016-03-07T15:10:56	Benjamin_Gust 'Doesn't matter' seems weak. It's a different case to the two nodes being inside the same circle, and therefore interesting.
JoMicheII	706858285782200320	2016-03-07T15:05:22	The Finance &amp; Development issue on demographics is very good indeed - 
JoMicheII	706858241385484289	2016-03-07T15:05:12	Benjamin_Gust Indeed. My paper is trying to figure out where to draw the circle when it comes to the IOUs of the shadow banking system.
JoMicheII	706849461918691328	2016-03-07T14:30:19	Benjamin_Gust Because I won't have much luck trying to buy a cup of coffee using your IOU.

JoMicheII	705336960685101057	2016-03-03T10:20:10	AbiWilks The problem is the pre-Corbyn Labour leadership were terrified to challenge the Osborne narrative and now is totally entrenched.
JoMicheII	705336613556060160	2016-03-03T10:18:47	AbiWilks The alternatives at the last leadership election were hopeless. Therein lies the problem in many ways.
JoMicheII	705336245971492864	2016-03-03T10:17:20	AbiWilks So I think it has to be a full-frontal assualt on the 'spending is dangerous' narrative. Difficult, but I think it's only option.
JoMicheII	705336079449202688	2016-03-03T10:16:40	AbiWilks The 'pretend we won't spend' route is a non-starter. Any sensible government programme is going to need to reverse austerity.

JoMicheII	705071457882210306	2016-03-02T16:45:09	Noahpinion PKE largely sees the long run as a succession of short runs. The idea of 'potential growth' fixed by preferences, tech, demogs..
JoMicheII	705071163249139712	2016-03-02T16:43:59	Noahpinion Then you are back to long-run supply-side determined equilibrium.
JoMicheII	705070953588518913	2016-03-02T16:43:09	Noahpinion You can only conceptualise market outcomes by recourse to 'imperfections', meaning that *if* those imperfections could be fixed.
JoMicheII	705070658389200896	2016-03-02T16:41:59	Noahpinion Recent discussion by neoclassical but sympathetic sjwrenlewis may shed some light: 
JoMicheII	705070188086104064	2016-03-02T16:40:07	Noahpinion These are still frictions/imperfections. The dual of an imperfect market is a perfect mark. PKE would reject that duality.
JoMicheII	705069917477969920	2016-03-02T16:39:02	Noahpinion Yes, but e.g. Calvo pricing was derided as 'ad-hoc' until someone came up with a micro optimisation-based explanation.
JoMicheII	705069390321082372	2016-03-02T16:36:56	Noahpinion ... get a handle on, no matter how much you put real balances into utility functions.

JoMicheII	705069123815010304	2016-03-02T16:35:53	Noahpinion Something like that, but there are shades of opinion here which I'm not doing justice too. PKE will accept that not everything..
JoMicheII	705068608347578368	2016-03-02T16:33:50	Noahpinion For example: I can't see how neoclassical econ can escape a long-run vertical Phillips curve. But that is rejected in PKE.

JoMicheII	705068042955452416	2016-03-02T16:31:35	Noahpinion On, e.g. inequality, money, finance, hysteresis etc. But there are fundamental methodological differences that mean these ...
JoMicheII	705067868757606401	2016-03-02T16:30:54	Noahpinion I don't think so. Actually, I think mainstream models are currently getting ever close to traditional PK results.
JoMicheII	705067451114004480	2016-03-02T16:29:14	Noahpinion Or, maybe more likely, it's both methodology and assumptions.
JoMicheII	705067356654071808	2016-03-02T16:28:52	Noahpinion Not sure I understand the question - I think we probably mean something different by 'methodology' - but I think the latter.
JoMicheII	705066640266944512	2016-03-02T16:26:01	Noahpinion I think there are other ways to define PKE, but the analysis of aggregate demand, employment and the labour markets one key area

JoMicheII	705066328789487616	2016-03-02T16:24:46	Noahpinion Back to your question. Definitions will vary but in this case, Schoder makes his definition clear on page 3...
JoMicheII	705066085196890112	2016-03-02T16:23:48	Noahpinion In that much should look familiar. It is Schoder's attempt to bridge the gap between neoclassical DSGE and PKE.
JoMicheII	705065950496878593	2016-03-02T16:23:16	Noahpinion Well I would actually classify this as a hybrid Post-Keynesian/neoclassical paper. That was partly why I picked it.

JoMicheII	704987736768385024	2016-03-02T11:12:29	dave_chivers Noahpinion OK, I see your point. That's a more difficult one - it will come down to a discussion of fundamental assumptions..
JoMicheII	704986211039977472	2016-03-02T11:06:25	dave_chivers Unfortunately, Noahpinion is more interested in blanket dismissal and snarky put-downs than serious dialogue.

JoMicheII	704983096928673792	2016-03-02T10:54:02	UnlearningEcon True. Been a long time since Keynes was the mainstream though :)
JoMicheII	704982808419237889	2016-03-02T10:52:54	UnlearningEcon Wasn't true in the heyday of New Classical and Real Business Cycle models and Washington Consensus. Big shift since then.

JoMicheII	704976052708360192	2016-03-02T10:26:03	dave_chivers Noahpinion But still can be expressed (at least partially) in mathematical form.
JoMicheII	704975990993321985	2016-03-02T10:25:48	dave_chivers Noahpinion But e.g. difference between Marxist view of capitalism and neoclassical is much deeper than wheter markets clear.
JoMicheII	704974933202378753	2016-03-02T10:21:36	dave_chivers Noahpinion Yes - the axioms are different. And there are methodological and (dare I say it?) ontogical issues.
JoMicheII	704974147647045636	2016-03-02T10:18:29	dave_chivers Noahpinion Sorry, I don't follow that one. Can you restate?
JoMicheII	704973181216542720	2016-03-02T10:14:38	dave_chivers Noahpinion How about 'methodological indivudualism' as a definition of 'mainstream'?
JoMicheII	704972964379430912	2016-03-02T10:13:47	dave_chivers Noahpinion But, on your definition, mathematical Post Keynesian or Marxist papers are then mainstream?
JoMicheII	704971622038511616	2016-03-02T10:08:27	dave_chivers Noahpinion 
JoMicheII	704971488202514432	2016-03-02T10:07:55	dave_chivers Noahpinion Disagree with that one. There is lots of non-mainstream mathematical modelling.
JoMicheII	704971042364760064	2016-03-02T10:06:08	.Noahpinion Here is a non-critical realist Post-Keynesian working paper, as requested. Please critique. 
JoMicheII	704970073891577856	2016-03-02T10:02:17	dave_chivers Noahpinion IMO, behavioural is essentially neoclassical because alway benchmarked against 'rational' optimising individual.
JoMicheII	704969900075433986	2016-03-02T10:01:36	dave_chivers Noahpinion What would you consider to be non-neoclassical mainstream economics? Behavioural econ?
JoMicheII	704969569341992960	2016-03-02T10:00:17	Spencer_DavidA I'd like to seem them deal with that one. Agree about exams. I'm not on the current anti-exam bandwagon.

JoMicheII	704969124288581632	2016-03-02T09:58:31	Noahpinion Meaning you will have to critique PKE on it's own terms. A critique of critical realism isn't a critique of PKE.
JoMicheII	704968983221506048	2016-03-02T09:57:57	Noahpinion Many Post Keynesians wouldn't consider themselves critical realists. I.e. there is some overlap but you shouldn't conflate the 2
JoMicheII	704968820881027072	2016-03-02T09:57:19	Noahpinion The link between Post-Keynesian and critical realism is there but it's not that strong.

JoMicheII	704679312851652609	2016-03-01T14:46:55	DuncanWeldon Yep. Subscription makes sense for pretty much all (digital) media, IMO.

JoMicheII	704678863515869184	2016-03-01T14:45:08	DuncanWeldon Exactly - makes sense for 'consoles' to go the same way. I haven't played a video game since about 2008 and don't own a TV ...

JoMicheII	692474201303879680	2016-01-27T22:28:09	pdmsero Ok, let's save if for another time.
JoMicheII	692474067027365888	2016-01-27T22:27:37	pdmsero If all money is a form of credit, you can't use if for a barter exchange.  If it's a commodity on the other hand ...
JoMicheII	692473874894692352	2016-01-27T22:26:51	pdmsero We're in danger of getting dragged into deep discussions of monetary theory and philosophy. I think it's too late!
JoMicheII	692473627908927488	2016-01-27T22:25:53	pdmsero Why so fond? And they are pretty straightforward, no?
JoMicheII	692473398228836354	2016-01-27T22:24:58	pdmsero I'm not convinced. If you sell me a bike for cash, you aren't 'selling' the cash to buy the bike. You're swapping one for tother.
JoMicheII	692473154690781184	2016-01-27T22:24:00	pdmsero Yup, someone isn't going to get their money back. And that makes the double entry book-keeping really ugly.
JoMicheII	692472616108584965	2016-01-27T22:21:51	pdmsero Yes. If you insist on a transversality condition and long-run equilibrium, none of this is going to matter. All comes out in wash.
JoMicheII	692472236486324225	2016-01-27T22:20:21	pdmsero Agreed. Which is why the 'aggregate household net worth looks fine cos house prices are rising' story gives me the jitters a bit.
JoMicheII	692471906440716289	2016-01-27T22:19:02	pdmsero Well - when you sell assets you get a bank deposit in return. 'Selling' a bank deposit doesn't make sense to me. You spend it.
JoMicheII	692471601636458497	2016-01-27T22:17:49	pdmsero Yes if you drew the full unrealised capital gain each period from your savings account your net worth wldn't change.
JoMicheII	692471367338450944	2016-01-27T22:16:54	pdmsero I also wouldn't classify spending bank savings as selling assets but I suppose that's semantics.
JoMicheII	692471089285500929	2016-01-27T22:15:47	pdmsero Sure. But running down a bank account isn't realising capital gains in any way. You don't usually make capital gains on deposits.
JoMicheII	692470849937526785	2016-01-27T22:14:50	pdmsero Aha - there's the assumption. Yes, then we agree then. But I think bank account and house are different. Need to keep distinction.
JoMicheII	692470635503689728	2016-01-27T22:13:59	pdmsero Also macro paradoxes - if everyone thinks they getting richer, so spend more, total demand and employment increase - higher income!
JoMicheII	692470457417756673	2016-01-27T22:13:17	pdmsero No they can hold onto the asset (e.g. house) and burn through their savings account. Don't need to sell the house.
JoMicheII	692469976012341249	2016-01-27T22:11:22	pdmsero Saving (flow) can decrease, i.e. they can run down their savings (stock). That doesn't require new borrowing.
JoMicheII	692468773056581632	2016-01-27T22:06:35	pdmsero alongside new entry into market essentially sets up income transfers. E.g. from young to old via UK housing market.
JoMicheII	692468632115376129	2016-01-27T22:06:01	pdmsero No, you have to cash out. But (a) even unrealised gains affects behaviour and (b) ongoing dynamics of gains plus cashing out ...
JoMicheII	692468110075498496	2016-01-27T22:03:57	pdmsero You can have capital gains without borrowing. Or do I misunderstand the question?
JoMicheII	692466890778808320	2016-01-27T21:59:06	pdmsero so the distinction kind of breaks down. I think capital gains accounting is a big issue actually. One of my gripes with Piketty.
JoMicheII	692466716660633600	2016-01-27T21:58:25	pdmsero You are right in that the unrealised part of capital gains is still future earnings. But at the limit, can cash in immediately ...
JoMicheII	692465974860214272	2016-01-27T21:55:28	pdmsero That's essentially a cash transfer but through the back door.
JoMicheII	692465909307437059	2016-01-27T21:55:12	pdmsero Not if households are selling stock to cash in, but say a lower rate than buybacks so stock price still rising.
JoMicheII	692465487729561600	2016-01-27T21:53:32	pdmsero Corporations can use stock buybacks as a way to return profits to shareholders and bypass taxman. That's an income stream.
JoMicheII	692465252601073664	2016-01-27T21:52:36	pdmsero What about argument that corps doing stock buybacks instead of dividends but the two are functionally identical? Dividends are Y.
JoMicheII	692465111848652801	2016-01-27T21:52:02	pdmsero You don't even need borrowing. Perceived wealth can affect consumption decisions and changes in savings.
JoMicheII	692464556065583104	2016-01-27T21:49:50	pdmsero Yeah I know that feeling...
JoMicheII	692464230721798146	2016-01-27T21:48:32	pdmsero designed so capital gains can affect decisions.
JoMicheII	692464136740028416	2016-01-27T21:48:10	pdmsero Or at least that it affects their behaviour. G&amp;L define income 'correctly' in the accounting but the behavioural eqns are ...
JoMicheII	692464016174772224	2016-01-27T21:47:41	pdmsero Agreed - it's a thorny one. But also clear that some people regard the change in the value of their house as part of their income.

JoMicheII	686288732614451200	2016-01-10T20:49:19	georgemagnus1 TheEconomist And assuming no further recession? It's quite a lot of conditions to fulfil.

JoMicheII	686159204361441281	2016-01-10T12:14:37	schulte_stef DuncanWeldon colin93f yes, that might be what I'm thinking of. Footnote 57 - misremembered Wicksell but implicit from others
JoMicheII	686124084200124416	2016-01-10T09:55:03	colin93f schulte_stef they list Wicksell, Hayek and Minsky as influences, among others.
JoMicheII	686123894244261888	2016-01-10T09:54:18	colin93f schulte_stef there is a paper I think by borio and white in which they outline their theoretical framework...

JoMicheII	685738996782264320	2016-01-09T08:24:51	Gilesyb so strikes me as odd that he's back to it again. Noahpinion will have a different view.
JoMicheII	685738732524335104	2016-01-09T08:23:48	Gilesyb Noahpinion but he himself underwent a Damascene conversion a few years back and renounced 'Econ 101' as a theory of income dist.
JoMicheII	685738442945380352	2016-01-09T08:22:39	Gilesyb Noahpinion Krugman appears to endorse it - at least say 'we didn't ignore factor income distribution - we have a theory for that!'
JoMicheII	685737952845139969	2016-01-09T08:20:43	Gilesyb Noahpinion IMO the marginal productivity theory of income distribution - the J. B. Clark 'parables' - is wrong.

JoMicheII	685615958065590272	2016-01-09T00:15:57	Noahpinion I'm sure we both do - that's why we agree so effusively about everything.

JoMicheII	685047058886176768	2016-01-07T10:35:21	georgemagnus1 AmbroseEP I think Minsky and Hayek have much in common on matters of credit.
JoMicheII	685046914639859712	2016-01-07T10:34:46	georgemagnus1 AmbroseEP like Hayek, I think much good about the analysis even if I disagree with (some) conclusions.
JoMicheII	685046479078187008	2016-01-07T10:33:02	bswud JulienNoizet Gilesyb ok - issuing debt securities (bonds) is borrowing.

JoMicheII	684735061380448256	2016-01-06T13:55:35	JulienNoizet bswud Gilesyb issuing securities is called borrowing.
JoMicheII	684728650126770176	2016-01-06T13:30:06	bswud JulienNoizet Gilesyb ... demand = wealth effect. Switch from assets to goods is not portfolio change in itself. Separate mechanism.
JoMicheII	684728228364333056	2016-01-06T13:28:25	bswud JulienNoizet Gilesyb if portfolio balance only leads to asset purchases then no inflation - assets not in CPI. If leads to goods ..
JoMicheII	684727508617543680	2016-01-06T13:25:34	Gilesyb bswud JulienNoizet IMO QE probably less effect than claimed. But clear that (intended) aim of portfolio rebal is cost of finance.
JoMicheII	684727154257588224	2016-01-06T13:24:09	Gilesyb bswud JulienNoizet very hard to disentangle. How do we know credit wouldn't have contracted further without QE?
JoMicheII	684726917812060161	2016-01-06T13:23:13	Gilesyb bswud JulienNoizet need to distinguish between how BoE claims it works and what happens in reality. But given lack counterfactual
JoMicheII	684726486130159616	2016-01-06T13:21:30	Gilesyb bswud JulienNoizet also agree that companies' finance demand inelastic to interest rates. Reason DSGE models are wrong.
JoMicheII	684726098983317504	2016-01-06T13:19:58	bswud JulienNoizet Gilesyb yes wealth effect too. But wealth effect may imply delayed deleveraging.
JoMicheII	684725885052784640	2016-01-06T13:19:07	Gilesyb bswud JulienNoizet yes, agreed - the got it wrong. Thought bank lending channel would work but it didn't. Emphasis switch to PR.
JoMicheII	684725660120690688	2016-01-06T13:18:13	JulienNoizet bswud Gilesyb you are clutching at straws. Crystal clear from all BoE docs that this is the mechanism.
JoMicheII	684721477883674624	2016-01-06T13:01:36	bswud JulienNoizet Gilesyb read more carefully! 
JoMicheII	684720917113651200	2016-01-06T12:59:22	bswud JulienNoizet Gilesyb 'the lower cost of external finance should lead to a boost in consumption and investment spending'

JoMicheII	684717777291182082	2016-01-06T12:46:54	bswud JulienNoizet Gilesyb I know the bank lending channel didn't work. Portfolio rebal works by bringing down long interest rates...
JoMicheII	684715441579798528	2016-01-06T12:37:37	JulienNoizet Gilesyb bswud and /how/ does portfolio rebal increase AD? Explain the mechanism.

JoMicheII	684687819139342336	2016-01-06T10:47:51	JulienNoizet Gilesyb ok and how do higher asset prices produce increase in AD? Lower borrowing costs as a stimulus to lending.

JoMicheII	684684245273591808	2016-01-06T10:33:39	Gilesyb how is QE supposed to have any effect without an increase in lending (or less deleveraging)? Reduced interest servicing costs?

JoMicheII	684507552923693057	2016-01-05T22:51:32	Gilesyb but 'may' is important - as China shows. Can go too far the other way.
JoMicheII	684507260643610624	2016-01-05T22:50:23	Gilesyb over long run econ growth requires increase in productive capacity i.e. investment - no way round that. And current uk levels low.
JoMicheII	684506154496561152	2016-01-05T22:45:59	Gilesyb Depends on type but yes, probably, in short run. But may raise domestic output/productivity/exports in med. term.

JoMicheII	684501495358832640	2016-01-05T22:27:28	Gilesyb also, if wages not growing then consumption-led growth has obvious issues.
JoMicheII	684500701716856832	2016-01-05T22:24:19	asentance ok but as per OBR table above for those dates, hard to describe recovery as investment and export led. C contr &gt; I, net trade -ve
JoMicheII	684499772930134017	2016-01-05T22:20:37	Gilesyb consumption w/o investment not good for current ac.  And w/o investment, you'll have no economy to speak of over the longer term.

JoMicheII	684298203756388352	2016-01-05T08:59:40	Gilesyb Yes, can't rule that out. Would be nice but looks unlikely to me. Austerity might also give.

JoMicheII	682248775734181888	2015-12-30T17:15:58	Something else it would be nice to leave in 2015.

JoMicheII	682214656920961025	2015-12-30T15:00:23	RajaKorman Also for coordinated fiscal policy, IMO. What do you think of idea of regs aiming for balance between inward and outward FDI?

JoMicheII	682189583992401920	2015-12-30T13:20:45	Pete_Spence TheStalwart Why not! If anything will guarantee a global recovery, me staking cash on the opposite will!
JoMicheII	682188325164322816	2015-12-30T13:15:45	Pete_Spence TheStalwart Starts to get stuck in.
JoMicheII	682187773604950016	2015-12-30T13:13:34	Pete_Spence TheStalwart I'm going for lower. I reckon 2016 will be the year sec stag really gets stuck in.
