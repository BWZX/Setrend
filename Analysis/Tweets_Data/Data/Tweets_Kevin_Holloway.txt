Kevin_Holloway	722114873505656832	2016-04-18T17:29:36	LSValue DoubtfulAcct but I don't think 9k changes much &amp; is very achievable. So at a min 4% rev growth + V12, one offs, customization, pp
Kevin_Holloway	722114229617098752	2016-04-18T17:27:03	LSValue DoubtfulAcct look I agree valuation is not cheap. Also agree keeping the scarcity element is vital, which leads to growth issue...
Kevin_Holloway	722113352948781056	2016-04-18T17:23:34	LSValue DoubtfulAcct agree. So does scarcity effect go away at 9000 cars?
Kevin_Holloway	722113031493148672	2016-04-18T17:22:17	LSValue DoubtfulAcct how so? If you can sell your last purchase to fund your next one?  Pretty good incentive to keep buying.

Kevin_Holloway	722111890537644032	2016-04-18T17:17:45	DoubtfulAcct LSValue mkt share dec 4% yet shipments/revs still up. Reason they don't care abt mkt share. If anything shows untapped demand
Kevin_Holloway	722109530989928448	2016-04-18T17:08:22	DoubtfulAcct LSValue 23% mkt share of what? 2-3 yr waiting lists at times + value of car often increases after purchase. Demand is there
Kevin_Holloway	722107576855310337	2016-04-18T17:00:37	DoubtfulAcct LSValue as for gdp idk. In recent past yes. 
Kevin_Holloway	722107397238423552	2016-04-18T16:59:54	DoubtfulAcct LSValue market share is pretty much meaningless with 7-9k cars. I have no doubt they can sell 1400 more cars in 2019.
Kevin_Holloway	722106174112473088	2016-04-18T16:55:02	DoubtfulAcct LSValue what changed is my question? Do you not believe the 9000 est by 2019? Zero pricing pwr now? Mix shift from V8 to V12?
Kevin_Holloway	722105003113115649	2016-04-18T16:50:23	DoubtfulAcct LSValue I'm not disagreeing as much with value, as on the rev assumption
Kevin_Holloway	722104539621560321	2016-04-18T16:48:32	DoubtfulAcct LSValue from 2005-2014 revenues grew at 7% cagr. Why will this change?  In production alone it should be ~4% cagr by 2019.
Kevin_Holloway	722098608971980800	2016-04-18T16:24:58	LSValue why would they only grow at rate of inflation?
Kevin_Holloway	722066234628419584	2016-04-18T14:16:20	rationalwalk doubt it. I believe Gayner said on a stand alone basis Ventures would earn 20% plus ROIC. Can't seem to find that quote tho.

Kevin_Holloway	688074607849373696	2016-01-15T19:05:44	@fakehfm btw read your IBM piece yesterday. Not a shareholder but really enjoyed it, interesting stuff.
Kevin_Holloway	688036712535187456	2016-01-15T16:35:10	MarAzul_90 yeah that's what I've gathered so far. How do u become comfortable w/ 2?
Kevin_Holloway	688036405264662530	2016-01-15T16:33:56	@fakehfm jnvest and assuming Liberty takes control (likely), confident they will reinvest cash flows from Siri to better uses
Kevin_Holloway	688035733739802626	2016-01-15T16:31:16	@fakehfm jnvest def some concerns. What helps me sleep is I think it will take awhile to happen (if it does happen)...
Kevin_Holloway	688032968250494976	2016-01-15T16:20:17	MarAzul_90 I've been following the MCO discussions on here for awhile, lots of great info. Still need to dig in &amp; get comfortable.
Kevin_Holloway	688028865755779072	2016-01-15T16:03:59	SkeleCap jnvest whats a realistic time frame? Maffei said hearing in March if I'm not mistaken. Reason to believe we get a quick decision?
Kevin_Holloway	688025305731170307	2016-01-15T15:49:50	Watch list growing. Been eyeing MCO. I'm a neophyte here, but obviously a great biz, price looks reasonable. Day job restricting research..
Kevin_Holloway	688023248190214145	2016-01-15T15:41:39	jnvest curious what ur thoughts are on the attractiveness of the individual trackers. Braves tracker is the hardest one for me.

Kevin_Holloway	688000308035731456	2016-01-15T14:10:30	jay_21_ seems like it... Said he's already had offers of $2-3B on the table
Kevin_Holloway	688000002065477632	2016-01-15T14:09:17	rationalwalk as long as he doesn't announce it before he does it
Kevin_Holloway	687999660028395521	2016-01-15T14:07:56	jay_21_ parts biz next?
Kevin_Holloway	687713756990849024	2016-01-14T19:11:51	Find_Me_Value haha thought that was great. I like Frear, gave a lot of good insight on biz and future.

Kevin_Holloway	687357963426770944	2016-01-13T19:38:03	Kevin_Holloway unfortunately I like all of my current holdings at these prices so I can't/don't want to sell anything. Powerball time...

Kevin_Holloway	687282922420715520	2016-01-13T14:39:52	rationalwalk everyone once in awhile there are some thoughtful pieces.
Kevin_Holloway	687281356540358659	2016-01-13T14:33:39	rationalwalk put 2 of my blog posts on SA. Only thing worse than the quality is comment section. It's like FB mixed w/ yahoo message board.
Kevin_Holloway	687271895851466752	2016-01-13T13:56:03	rationalwalk looking fwd too it
Kevin_Holloway	687039174529171456	2016-01-12T22:31:18	Q&amp;A also great. In typical Sergio fashion gives his unfiltered opinion on GM merger &amp; autonomous cars FCAU
Kevin_Holloway	687038731543523330	2016-01-12T22:29:32	Great lecture by Sergio on leadership. Quotes philosophers, economists, literature. Rare kind of CEO h/t txlaw_v2

Kevin_Holloway	686556311920750593	2016-01-11T14:32:35	ElliotTurn of course w/o Ferrari FCA is a little riskier. Add disruption from tech, autonomous, emission standards. Still like it here tho.
Kevin_Holloway	686555780607275008	2016-01-11T14:30:28	ElliotTurn sale would be (accrd to Sergio) $2-3B, 20-30% of the mkt cap. That's crazy. Even w/o op execution theres good upside optionality
Kevin_Holloway	686553557428994048	2016-01-11T14:21:38	ElliotTurn yeah I have no idea. Certainly not banking on any deal. Selling the parts biz still possible tho.

Kevin_Holloway	685213783065772032	2016-01-07T21:37:51	Kevin_Holloway anyway that's it, some quick thoughts. Should be a post soon from another FinTwit regular in more detail.
Kevin_Holloway	685213515045564416	2016-01-07T21:36:47	Kevin_Holloway bunch of other little details. Frear seems very upfront, honest, not promotional. Actually like him more than Meyer.
Kevin_Holloway	685213427946631169	2016-01-07T21:36:26	Kevin_Holloway good stuff on content, Connected car, leverage, Liberty, buybacks

Kevin_Holloway	685211444489641984	2016-01-07T21:28:33	Kevin_Holloway we got 80m cars on the rd assuming mid 70's prod penetration. Going to take another 10 yrs to get where u build out fleet.
Kevin_Holloway	685211105799573504	2016-01-07T21:27:12	Kevin_Holloway Frear said, when churn = gross adds you go sideways in the biz. Moderator says that would be 40m subs. Didn't comment on #
Kevin_Holloway	685210367073611776	2016-01-07T21:24:16	Kevin_Holloway Very good talk. Lot of detail on SIRI, wanted to hit on just a few of the more interesting things said

Kevin_Holloway	685141043248009217	2016-01-07T16:48:48	Find_Me_Value thats weird. They had it posted this morning and must of took it off.

Kevin_Holloway	685116297726824448	2016-01-07T15:10:28	MarAzul_90 hmm weird, they took the link down
Kevin_Holloway	685114067393077248	2016-01-07T15:01:37	Kevin_Holloway that's a wrap. There is much more on non LMCA if ur interested.

Kevin_Holloway	685112402912899072	2016-01-07T14:55:00	Kevin_Holloway LYV: very interrelated strengths, enables other strengths. Thought it was attractively priced when they upped stake
Kevin_Holloway	685112113279426560	2016-01-07T14:53:51	Kevin_Holloway On LYV: strong mgmt team, oppty to fill in port, use scale to grow, improve tech/mobile, ecommerce/sponsorship benefits
Kevin_Holloway	685110437105516544	2016-01-07T14:47:11	Kevin_Holloway "A way to get incremental capital in a tax free way from Braves to LMCA."  Why? "We like being able to write big checks."
Kevin_Holloway	685110197971464193	2016-01-07T14:46:14	Kevin_Holloway ...A potential source of capital to raise, we can sell that stock on a tax free basis."

Kevin_Holloway	685102595694813184	2016-01-07T14:16:02	Kevin_Holloway on SIRI leverage: they'll work it back up slowly to 4x

Kevin_Holloway	684408315598778368	2016-01-05T16:17:12	raybonneau the author wrote a bunch of pieces, pretty balanced IMO. Shows what wasn't mentioned in the doc, but also alt suspects
