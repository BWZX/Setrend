TheDomino	695251792305717248	2016-02-04T14:25:19	CraigScott31 agreed...hard to lump in COP w/ XOM CVX, but they've held up a lot better than it has (integrated v. E&amp;P)
TheDomino	695251377329692673	2016-02-04T14:23:40	CramersShirt At least he's got a proper jacket on... Shkreli
TheDomino	695251216507469824	2016-02-04T14:23:01	That's totally what Thumper's mom told him! 
TheDomino	695250806510067712	2016-02-04T14:21:24	CraigScott31 definitely not its worst day, but interesting to kick off your earnings press release with a comment on your dividend policy?
TheDomino	695234937071521792	2016-02-04T13:18:20	LowHandicap1 ReformedBroker absolutely!
TheDomino	695231219391467520	2016-02-04T13:03:34	To be fair...ExxonMobil &amp; Chevron aren't in the same market cap field as ConocoPhillips...and XOM CVX are integrated plays, COP just E&amp;P
TheDomino	695230979011657728	2016-02-04T13:02:36	Entering today's trade, here's how these oil cos stacked up (1-yr perf, Dividend Yield) XOM -15%, 3.7% CVX -23%, 5.1% COP -43%, 7.7%
TheDomino	695228062951161857	2016-02-04T12:51:01	Dividend yield certainly a signal...so is relative strength... 1-Yr returns: XOM -15% CVX -23% COP -43% 
TheDomino	695227226204291072	2016-02-04T12:47:42	Maybe it's an obvious statement...but given pain in crude oil, dividend &amp; CapEx cuts are expected in the industry...question is, who's safe?
TheDomino	695226776805629952	2016-02-04T12:45:54	wboscoho ReformedBroker setting lower expectations is key ;)
TheDomino	695226449159155712	2016-02-04T12:44:36	8x57patronen IvanTheK That's a big question mark now...will the dividend be safe at Dow components XOM CVX
TheDomino	695225932160856068	2016-02-04T12:42:33	ReformedBroker Shocking, I know
TheDomino	695225728003104769	2016-02-04T12:41:44	Don't forget the all you can drink fountain drinks and cereal and Doritos ;) 
TheDomino	695224363105189888	2016-02-04T12:36:19	Now...question is...fair to question dividends of the oil majors? ExxonMobil XOM or Chevron CVX 
TheDomino	695222829764186112	2016-02-04T12:30:13	BTW, the lede in the ConocoPhillips COP *EARNINGS* press release was NOT earnings, it WAS the dividend cut 
TheDomino	695222268675383296	2016-02-04T12:28:00	Especially in times of balance sheet stress... 
TheDomino	695222110025838594	2016-02-04T12:27:22	It wasn't a dream dude 
TheDomino	695221164298342400	2016-02-04T12:23:36	ConocoPhillips COP -4% on 7k shares premarket trading volume after earnings report &amp; dividend cut
TheDomino	695220890292854786	2016-02-04T12:22:31	The reason why ConocoPhillips COP dividend reduction is important is because it was thought of as "safer" compared to others in industry
TheDomino	695220670662365185	2016-02-04T12:21:39	ConocoPhillips COP also lowers planned 2016 Capital Expenditures to $6.4B from $7.7B, production expected to be flat compared to 2015
TheDomino	695219985728327680	2016-02-04T12:18:55	And so it begins... Oil giant ConocoPhillips COP slashes dividend payment to $0.25 per quarter, it was $0.74
