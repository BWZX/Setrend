JGForsyth	701816560785162241	2016-02-22T17:11:21	Early stretch on collective responsibility as Priti Patel's bullish response to Cameron's statement arrives as PM still speaking
JGForsyth	701814505223888896	2016-02-22T17:03:11	But the tone of Cameron's performance will make it harder for him to call on Tory MPs to play nicely during the referendum
JGForsyth	701814253360181248	2016-02-22T17:02:11	So far, Cameron hasn't had a blow landed on him. He has successfully dodged every difficult question. Will be relief in Number 10 tonight
JGForsyth	701813817219661825	2016-02-22T17:00:27	Cameron bringing Boris' family into this debate in the way he has 2day means that the gloves will come off in this campaign on the Tory side
JGForsyth	701813001633079296	2016-02-22T16:57:13	Cameron now starting to enjoy this, relishes Ann Clwyd saying that Stanley Johnson speaks more sense than Boris
JGForsyth	701810760050208775	2016-02-22T16:48:18	Deadline for designation is 4th March 2016

JGForsyth	701803413764440066	2016-02-22T16:19:07	Cameron still can't say when the first benefits get paid in the 4 year window
JGForsyth	701801737385074688	2016-02-22T16:12:27	Boris far more polite to Cameron, than Cameron was to him. But think this round goes to Cameron. NB Cameron did not say he respected Boris
JGForsyth	701798243659862016	2016-02-22T15:58:34	Boris Johnson is standing up trying to catch Speaker's eye in the Commons. Intervention coming.
JGForsyth	701796693294104576	2016-02-22T15:52:25	If Boris had any doubts. that he had crossed the Rubicon, Cameron's statement will have removed them. This vote is his moment of discrimen
JGForsyth	701795856752758784	2016-02-22T15:49:05	Another Cameron dig at Boris, 'I have no other agenda' than what is best for this country

JGForsyth	701792753655672832	2016-02-22T15:36:45	Doesn't look great just having a gap to the PM's right MattChorley
JGForsyth	701791838584307712	2016-02-22T15:33:07	Grayling--an Outer--sitting directly to Cameron's right for the statement, and so presumably in the television shot
JGForsyth	701791097232691200	2016-02-22T15:30:10	Cameron sitting next to an Outer, John Hayes, ahead of his statement

JGForsyth	701533091165294592	2016-02-21T22:24:57	So, Charles Moore has been key to 2 biggest decisions of Boris's political career: to run 4 London Mayor &amp; to go OUT

JGForsyth	701514143048847360	2016-02-21T21:09:39	Boris's column in Telegraph is up 
JGForsyth	701504437165150208	2016-02-21T20:31:05	Now, another Johnson brother wades into the EU referendum debate... 
JGForsyth	701488715751886848	2016-02-21T19:28:37	This referendum is now a battle between two visions of the future, for both the country and the Conservative Party 
JGForsyth	701487112533757952	2016-02-21T19:22:15	Tory MP’s take: The scholarship class [Boris and Gove] and the lower sixth [junior ministers] are now in full revolt
JGForsyth	701483195242565636	2016-02-21T19:06:41	Osborne wanted this ref to be a choice between future / past for both the country and the Tories. It now won’t be 
JGForsyth	701469807657537536	2016-02-21T18:13:29	Striking that it is Boris’ predecessor as MP for Henley who is being used to attack his decision to back voting to Leave
JGForsyth	701464842440413184	2016-02-21T17:53:45	Number 10 say there was "some contact" on Saturday from Boris. So at least the Prime Minister read the email.
JGForsyth	701463213746102276	2016-02-21T17:47:17	Boris informed David Cameron of his plan to back Brexit in an email on Saturday morning. There was no reply.
JGForsyth	701460086263308293	2016-02-21T17:34:51	One former Cameron aide's take on what Boris is up to, not hugely charitable  
JGForsyth	701457727491596288	2016-02-21T17:25:29	You can read the full transcript of what Boris said about voting leave here 
JGForsyth	701455600442544128	2016-02-21T17:17:02	My colleague IsabelHardman reports. Boris: I will be advocating Vote Leave... or whatever the team is called 
JGForsyth	701453674837626885	2016-02-21T17:09:23	Just a few weeks ago, Downing Street confident Tories 4 Brexit wld be ‘small and, frankly, unattractive’. Now faced with Boris, Gove &amp; Priti
JGForsyth	701452944462495744	2016-02-21T17:06:28	Boris v cleverly telling media that they need to come to him if they want to hear his views on EU, meaning appearances will be on his terms
JGForsyth	701452596360454146	2016-02-21T17:05:05	Islington now a hotbed of Brexit. Not just Boris Johnson but campaign director Dominic Cummings and chief spinner Paul Stephenson
JGForsyth	701451615157534722	2016-02-21T17:01:12	Boris weaving a lot of Vote Leave's slogans and soundbites into this statement, stressing leaving would save money and take back control
JGForsyth	701450902302027776	2016-02-21T16:58:22	But Boris says that he won't be taking part in TV debates against other Tories. (But main TV event likely to be a Question Time style event)
JGForsyth	701450705576587264	2016-02-21T16:57:35	Boris says 'I will be advocating Vote Leave'
JGForsyth	701441965120999425	2016-02-21T16:22:51	Boris isn't a member of the Cabinet, so could speak in the Commons tomorrow in response to Cameron's statement on EU referendum
JGForsyth	701441443118899201	2016-02-21T16:20:46	Foreign Office was Boris’s for the taking if he had backed IN, so he is taking a risk with this decision
JGForsyth	701439471393357825	2016-02-21T16:12:56	Gove gave OUT intellectual heft, Boris now giving it popular appeal. This referendum will be a proper contest now 
JGForsyth	701437772561776640	2016-02-21T16:06:11	Really don’t think Cameron &amp; Osborne had factored Boris going Out into their calculations until a few days ago, thought Boris’ gut was proEU
JGForsyth	701437509360885760	2016-02-21T16:05:08	Cameron always used to point out that Boris had never actually advocated BREXIT. But at 10pm, BoJo will do just that 
JGForsyth	701437030589452288	2016-02-21T16:03:14	Cameron never actually expected Boris to back Brexit, rather than just flirting with it, until a few days ago 
JGForsyth	701433464776749056	2016-02-21T15:49:04	But doesn't that reflect Tory dominance? As with New Labour &amp; Blair/Brown, all politics is contained within one party at mo Robert___Harris
JGForsyth	701430752404230145	2016-02-21T15:38:17	Vote Leave quick off the mark. They have left a brolly and a hat outside Boris's front door. 
JGForsyth	701367516262768640	2016-02-21T11:27:01	Contrary to what Cameron and Osborne say, Gove hasn't been an Outer for 30 years  
JGForsyth	701360199072878592	2016-02-21T10:57:56	Contrary to what Cameron and Osborne say, Gove hasn’t been an Outer for 30 years. It is government that changed him 
JGForsyth	701344894799978496	2016-02-21T09:57:07	It is a good day for journalists when the Prime Minister is briefing out what was said in a Cabinet meeting live on national television
JGForsyth	701343839680864258	2016-02-21T09:52:56	Quite a risk for Cameron to make a direct appeal to Boris live on national TV
JGForsyth	701343121976770560	2016-02-21T09:50:05	This argument that the referendum is itself an act of sovereignty was made by the Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb in Cabinet yesterday
JGForsyth	701342129356992512	2016-02-21T09:46:08	That was the strongest bit of Cameron's pitch, and he knew it
JGForsyth	701341505634627584	2016-02-21T09:43:39	Telling how many times in this i/view that Cameron has referred to 'Nigel Farage', clear who he wants his opponent in this referendum to be
JGForsyth	701341040712744961	2016-02-21T09:41:49	Think Cameron had to stifle a giggle when Marr declared 'imagine me as a Hungarian'
JGForsyth	701336860509995009	2016-02-21T09:25:12	Some of those close to Sturgeon regard Brexit as bad basis for a 2nd indy ref because it would make the currency/border questions more acute
JGForsyth	701336253250347008	2016-02-21T09:22:47	Hope Marr asks Sturgeon abt fiscal framework talks, hugely important for the future of UK but isn't being covered enough south of the border
JGForsyth	701080142395924481	2016-02-20T16:25:06	The other key UK story right now: fiscal framework talks. The SNP’s attitude shows Nat indy economics don’t add up 
JGForsyth	700987139065036801	2016-02-20T10:15:32	German-born MP GiselaStuart says she'll vote to leave the European Union  
JGForsyth	701057988157689856	2016-02-20T14:57:04	What was said at the EU referendum Cabinet  
JGForsyth	701056441508089857	2016-02-20T14:50:55	Hear Oliver Letwin, a long standing Eurosceptic, was the most persuasive speaker for IN at the EU referendum Cabinet 
JGForsyth	701033719189127168	2016-02-20T13:20:37	Gove’s statement, so well crafted and argued, shows why his backing is such an adrenalin shot to Out camp. Gives it proper intellectual heft

JGForsyth	701031792808165376	2016-02-20T13:12:58	Gove statement passionate &amp; eloquent. Says voters should know 'government is not, ultimately, in control in hundreds of areas that matter'
JGForsyth	701025132471590914	2016-02-20T12:46:30	So, vote_leave has secured the support of every Cabinet Minister who is backing Brexit. Will help with Electoral Commission designation

JGForsyth	700987955742187522	2016-02-20T10:18:47	Sajid Javid backing IN a blow to the Out campaign. It had hoped that he would help persuade voters that Brexit wouldn't be bad for business

JGForsyth	700828710404919296	2016-02-19T23:45:59	Cameron is IN’s biggest asset. That he’s not standing as PM again will make it easier for him to portray himself as ‘father of the nation'
JGForsyth	700823709771128832	2016-02-19T23:26:07	Different press conferences, different deal. Cameron: there will be treaty change. Hollande: no treaty change. EUCO

JGForsyth	700811705908129796	2016-02-19T22:38:25	Don't think it's right to say Gove has wanted Brexit for 30 years. Friends say that it is experience of being a minister radicalised him 1/2
