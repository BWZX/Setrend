dlknowles	705720835030568960	2016-03-04T11:45:33	Shelter I mean I also dislike the framing, because what I really want to know is how much more renting costs than owning

dlknowles	705665630662475776	2016-03-04T08:06:11	AbiWilks BernieSanders But those jobs will have been made up for by other jobs in new industries enabled by trade
dlknowles	705665538102579201	2016-03-04T08:05:49	AbiWilks BernieSanders In terms of cars built, I'd be surprised, though some down-stream businesses have moved to Mexico

dlknowles	705664249281060865	2016-03-04T08:00:42	AbiWilks BernieSanders But also, the particular decline of the *City of Detroit* (as opposed to the suffering Michigan) is much deeper too
dlknowles	705664084113530882	2016-03-04T08:00:02	AbiWilks BernieSanders The American automobile industry moved to places like Atlanta (as well as Detroit's suburbs)

dlknowles	705660183826079745	2016-03-04T07:44:33	Most of Detroit's jobs didn't move to Mexico. They moved to suburban Detroit, which is still pretty rich, along with the white people
dlknowles	705659855504338944	2016-03-04T07:43:14	Not many people know it, but this is total balls. If any *one* thing killed Detroit, it was racism: 
dlknowles	705658897512660992	2016-03-04T07:39:26	biettetimmons Also, red-lining and then white flight to the suburbs to flee desegregation of schools. Metro-Detroit is still pretty rich.

dlknowles	689919884621434880	2016-01-20T21:18:13	JonnElledge Yep. Also the unnecessary famines, the theft of land for British settlers, the racist administration
dlknowles	689913395362021377	2016-01-20T20:52:26	sparkiticus Hm. I don't feel any shame. Luck certainly, and a nagging awareness of it. But not shame
dlknowles	689911387649372160	2016-01-20T20:44:27	sparkiticus Well what it is then? How do you answer a question of good or bad otherwise?
dlknowles	689909578360844288	2016-01-20T20:37:16	rafaelbehr Hard to imagine a world without it though isn't it?
dlknowles	689909246549450753	2016-01-20T20:35:56	sparkiticus I think we can judge parts of the project as good or bad. But the whole of it is too big to look at in moral terms
dlknowles	689908976339828736	2016-01-20T20:34:52	sparkiticus I probably shouldn't have such controversial arguments in public
dlknowles	689908659724369924	2016-01-20T20:33:37	sparkiticus South Africa is a creation of empire. I'm here now. Take away empire and what is this country? Who are its people?

dlknowles	689908314537398272	2016-01-20T20:32:14	rafaelbehr But some things - empire, industrial revolution, etc - just seem too big to make that judgement
dlknowles	689908114586497034	2016-01-20T20:31:27	rafaelbehr Except that obviously we can do that. We can say that the holocaust was an awful thing
dlknowles	689907815117373442	2016-01-20T20:30:15	rafaelbehr Yes true. I mean maybe I'm just making a v obvious point which is just that moral judgments about history are mostly silly
dlknowles	689907320470503426	2016-01-20T20:28:17	sparkiticus Well precisely. I wouldn't toss the dice &amp; try a world with a different history. Maybe other, less privileged people would
dlknowles	689906519731802112	2016-01-20T20:25:06	Londoneuro rafaelbehr No. I don't think it was a good thing. I l think it's impossible to really judge that
dlknowles	689906274205618180	2016-01-20T20:24:08	sparkiticus Of course.
dlknowles	689905887352348672	2016-01-20T20:22:36	rafaelbehr Yes there is pre-colonial history of pre-colonial societies. But it is next to impossible to imagine Africa now without empire
dlknowles	689905637476667393	2016-01-20T20:21:36	rafaelbehr I mean I'm now reporting on Africa. This entire continent is totally shaped by empire.
dlknowles	689905457624932353	2016-01-20T20:20:53	rafaelbehr It's far easier to imagine a world without the history of USSR than one without empire
dlknowles	689905350305259521	2016-01-20T20:20:27	rafaelbehr To a degree. I do think that the USSR's influence on the world now was not nearly so transformative
dlknowles	689905209745743872	2016-01-20T20:19:54	I am kind of glad it happened. Because I rather like my life and the world I live in. But that's not the same as pride
dlknowles	689904875082244096	2016-01-20T20:18:34	I'm not ashamed or proud of the British empire any more than I am of the industrial revolution. It's just a thing that happened
dlknowles	689903805215981568	2016-01-20T20:14:19	And that's basically impossible, or at least absurd. The modern world as we know it is a product of empire
dlknowles	689903656762761217	2016-01-20T20:13:44	Empire did lots of things, many many bad, some good. But to assess the whole thing means imagining a world where there was no empire

dlknowles	689864025878982656	2016-01-20T17:36:15	biettetimmons Which is fine I guess - the white liberal left is full of hypocrisy - but still annoying
dlknowles	689863948385001472	2016-01-20T17:35:57	biettetimmons TNC is pretending the guy is a principled left-winger and then using that to hit the white liberal left's principles
dlknowles	689863769414057984	2016-01-20T17:35:14	biettetimmons He's trying to shift Hillary to the left and the main way to do that is to trouble her in NH and Iowa, both v white states
dlknowles	689863610198261760	2016-01-20T17:34:36	biettetimmons "the implausibility of Sanders posing as a pragmatist". Of course he's a pragmatist. See him on guns. And his vote is white
dlknowles	689863480573366272	2016-01-20T17:34:05	biettetimmons I think my main problem with that TNC piece is it rests on the idea that BS is not a pragmatic, ordinary politician
dlknowles	689861311937822720	2016-01-20T17:25:28	biettetimmons Because it is the distribution of wealth - more than income - that represents the legacy of the past
dlknowles	689861095255904256	2016-01-20T17:24:36	biettetimmons Well I would concentrate on devising a fairer, more redistributive tax system - taxing in particular wealth, not just income
dlknowles	689859985346531328	2016-01-20T17:20:12	biettetimmons Not to mention that it will come at the expense of at least some people who are
dlknowles	689858597510082561	2016-01-20T17:14:41	biettetimmons Geographical targeting &amp; wealth targeting. But whatever you do it will help lots of people who are not descended from slaves
dlknowles	689858142205775872	2016-01-20T17:12:52	biettetimmons Yeah, a sort of inverse new deal, which targeted rural poor more, but feel like in practice the differences would be small
dlknowles	689857649274404866	2016-01-20T17:10:55	biettetimmons White poverty tends to be rural; black urban. So you could design "reparations" to be race-targeted by targeting cities, etc
dlknowles	689857515891396608	2016-01-20T17:10:23	biettetimmons Agree on the latter point, not the former. I mean there are structural differences in white poverty and black poverty
dlknowles	689856194937253892	2016-01-20T17:05:08	biettetimmons Any reparations programme, however presented, would resemble what BS is for - a more redistributive state.
dlknowles	689856093938413568	2016-01-20T17:04:44	biettetimmons After all, the Tulsa riots were in 1921. TNC isn't proposing we actually write individual cheques to the victims
dlknowles	689856002544504833	2016-01-20T17:04:22	biettetimmons Which is important. But policy-prescription wise it makes very little difference.
dlknowles	689855707865321473	2016-01-20T17:03:12	biettetimmons Right, but this is my point. It's about "why" we're redistributing money, not who to
dlknowles	689855293233192961	2016-01-20T17:01:33	biettetimmons Reparations is about the inherited costs of past injustice. What he mentions: employment gaps/wage gaps
dlknowles	689855071555837952	2016-01-20T17:00:40	biettetimmons Really? I'm rereading it now and I think he tries and fails
dlknowles	689854467546681345	2016-01-20T16:58:16	biettetimmons The policy prescription is the same, redistribution from rich to poor, whether or not you call it "reparations"
dlknowles	689854317730332672	2016-01-20T16:57:40	biettetimmons Because they're poor and screwed by capitalism. Or rather to the same people because they're black and screwed by history
dlknowles	689854162771800064	2016-01-20T16:57:03	biettetimmons Well true. But it's odd seeing the American left arguing about whether it is important to redistribute to people...
dlknowles	689853625875697667	2016-01-20T16:54:55	biettetimmons I do feel like this is mostly an argument about semantics and positioning, not actual policy

dlknowles	687734457428783105	2016-01-14T20:34:06	danwilsoncraw owenhatherley Was that a) exits create evictions/churn and b) remaining landlords may try to recoup higher costs

dlknowles	687714213763137536	2016-01-14T19:13:40	travelling_wolf owenhatherley In perfectly competitive theory, yeah, but I think real rental markets are stickier than that
dlknowles	687713086585880577	2016-01-14T19:09:11	Victoria_Spratt owenhatherley Me? No you're right. Any renter who can't afford to buy basically stands to suffer from this
dlknowles	687712631369666561	2016-01-14T19:07:23	owenhatherley Yeah I mean I think if you have an expanding social housing programme, screwing landlords makes more sense
dlknowles	687712158524780544	2016-01-14T19:05:30	owenhatherley Haha fair enough
dlknowles	687712007425028101	2016-01-14T19:04:54	owenhatherley And at the expense of landlords too of course,but they'll pass on some of the costs to the poor is what i mean
dlknowles	687711814289854464	2016-01-14T19:04:08	owenhatherley But it's a boon for young but affluent-ish renters who want to buy at the expense of renters who will never buy
dlknowles	687711718097711108	2016-01-14T19:03:45	owenhatherley I think Osborne has done it because he genuinely wants to increase homeownership. Which this may well do
dlknowles	687711654440779776	2016-01-14T19:03:30	owenhatherley Oh well yeah some will hike rents to make up for extra costs, if they can. Again, not great for renters
dlknowles	687710589104308225	2016-01-14T18:59:16	owenhatherley Yeah

dlknowles	687710268181327872	2016-01-14T18:57:59	owenhatherley If landlords aren't making money, they'll sell up. Lots of stock comes on the market for those who can afford deposits
dlknowles	687710059300782080	2016-01-14T18:57:09	owenhatherley I mean it's good for people like, um, me who might be able to afford a deposit. But not for genuinely poor renters
dlknowles	687709937619857410	2016-01-14T18:56:40	owenhatherley You say that, but in the absence of new social housing building, stuffing landlords is probably not a good thing

dlknowles	687352585993457664	2016-01-13T19:16:41	.Birdyword Well true. But you'd have to be SO utterly, irredeemably racist to enjoy this on its face value, surely?

dlknowles	687351234160885760	2016-01-13T19:11:19	I feel like it could be very dark humour about Europe's ever-changing attitudes to migrants. That's what I want it to be. But I don't know

dlknowles	687336518386585600	2016-01-13T18:12:50	AbiWilks I mean yes and no. There are other ways to protect private property. No state in Somalia and plenty of private property
dlknowles	687288763475726338	2016-01-13T15:03:05	you’ve got to admit it’s a very real issue 
dlknowles	687294809619456000	2016-01-13T15:27:06	MissEllieMae I mean you might be right. I'm genuinely not totally convinced by my reasoning. Just not that persuaded by case for change
dlknowles	687294426465579013	2016-01-13T15:25:35	MissEllieMae Maybe &amp; that does make some sense. But that also takes it out of its original context
dlknowles	687293277435998208	2016-01-13T15:21:01	MissEllieMae Protestors cut its hand off to commemorate the Congolese who died as a result of his rapaciousness. Council left it like that
dlknowles	687293130320777216	2016-01-13T15:20:26	MissEllieMae I feel like you can keep the statue and change its function. One example I liked was one of King Leopold in Belgium
dlknowles	687292692737486848	2016-01-13T15:18:41	MissEllieMae I'm not saying they're put up for that purpose. I'm saying they can shift to it as our thoughts change
dlknowles	687292230114131968	2016-01-13T15:16:51	MissEllieMae Even if it came from a fairly awful past. As I say I'm much less conflicted about his statues in SA
dlknowles	687292139416453120	2016-01-13T15:16:29	MissEllieMae And I say, with Oxford - it seems more honest to accept that Rhodes's money changed the university for the better
dlknowles	687292006855499776	2016-01-13T15:15:58	MissEllieMae Well yes, quite. And the statues are a reminder of the past - and its legacy
dlknowles	687291759383195648	2016-01-13T15:14:59	MissEllieMae Would you argue for tearing down statues of Oliver Cromwell?
dlknowles	687291409032962048	2016-01-13T15:13:35	MissEllieMae Of course but their purpose changes over time. We have plenty of statues of awful people still standing
dlknowles	687290812695244800	2016-01-13T15:11:13	MissEllieMae I don't think removing it would be "airbrushing history". But I'm not convinced leaving it up "venerates" the guy either
dlknowles	687290598362079232	2016-01-13T15:10:22	MissEllieMae In particular, with the one at Oriel college in Oxford - taking away the statue doesn't get rid of the money &amp; the legacy
dlknowles	687290273248968704	2016-01-13T15:09:05	MissEllieMae I'm genuinely divided on this, although I'm not sure my reasoning is great. Less so w regards statues in SA, but in the UK.
