AlexParkerDC	721911440144273408	2016-04-18T04:01:14	Doesn't mean you can do anything. (E.g. Robin w/the Bernie Sanders Brooklyn accent). But Connery played a Soviet sub commander, FFS.

AlexParkerDC	721905950865649664	2016-04-18T03:39:25	I remember it being well-received at the time, denigrated later, it's personally grown on me over the years.

AlexParkerDC	721901393838284804	2016-04-18T03:21:19	katherinejnowak Or people go for easy explanations--African-Americans have always loved the Clintons, etc. That can't be all.
AlexParkerDC	721901280587816961	2016-04-18T03:20:52	katherinejnowak Me too, basically. There may just not be enough data to figure it out yet.
AlexParkerDC	721900697583816704	2016-04-18T03:18:33	JNicholsonInDC I think this is really about basically different ways people conceptualize the world, who the enemies are.

AlexParkerDC	721896821023457280	2016-04-18T03:03:08	katherinejnowak But why do you think they're voting against Hillary?
AlexParkerDC	721896728337727490	2016-04-18T03:02:46	katherinejnowak On the specific point, I don't think voters care so much anymore who the likely nominee is.
AlexParkerDC	721895292946276352	2016-04-18T02:57:04	Thomg57 I remember there was this weird valley w/Obama--he'd win very white &amp; very black states.
AlexParkerDC	721894761733439488	2016-04-18T02:54:58	Yes, maybe he wins those states because they're very white, but that's not really an explanation, just a layer of the mystery.
AlexParkerDC	721893461084016640	2016-04-18T02:49:47	Maybe the few remaining Dems in a conservative state would be super-liberal, but that hasn't been the case in previous years, I believe.

AlexParkerDC	713754351991451648	2016-03-26T15:47:53	Side note on whole Trump media access issue: Many of the other candidates would find it physically exhausting to do so many interviews.
AlexParkerDC	713751552805183488	2016-03-26T15:36:45	This nails a lot of what bugs people with this current crop of superhero movies: 
AlexParkerDC	713749656174505984	2016-03-26T15:29:13	Not a direct quote but: "The question used to be: How do we top ourselves? The new one seems to be: How do we stop ourselves?"
AlexParkerDC	713749090962636800	2016-03-26T15:26:58	Ah, here it is: 
AlexParkerDC	713747698453782529	2016-03-26T15:21:26	Hey, Kevin Smith is in a Law &amp; Order episode?
AlexParkerDC	713747358647975936	2016-03-26T15:20:05	Nobody! 
AlexParkerDC	713747244822999041	2016-03-26T15:19:38	Anyone remember where that interview is?
AlexParkerDC	713747015868542977	2016-03-26T15:18:44	He said something like, "Technically STID didn't have to end w/the ship crashing into SF, but it sure felt like it did."
AlexParkerDC	713746852584271872	2016-03-26T15:18:05	Back in 2013, Damon Lindelof did an interview where he talked about the pressure to really scale up big Hollywood tentpole movies.
AlexParkerDC	713746218975756288	2016-03-26T15:15:34	I didn't even manage to catch London Has Fallen, and I'm a big fan of the Has Fallen franchise.
AlexParkerDC	713728926632255489	2016-03-26T14:06:51	SonnyBunch You mean Day of the Dead, that one where the girl from American Beauty is the main zombie ass-kicker?
AlexParkerDC	713726933545197569	2016-03-26T13:58:56	SonnyBunch I guess I don't see how MoS was that much better than BvS.
AlexParkerDC	713725769432875009	2016-03-26T13:54:18	More practically, they hired Chris Nolan, which turned out to be genius. He picked Zack Snyder for MoS. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
AlexParkerDC	713725222021701632	2016-03-26T13:52:07	Because making an animated series is different from making a movie, tho hard to believe they'd be worse.

AlexParkerDC	713572829946585088	2016-03-26T03:46:34	I don't like the knock on (Scott) Snyder's current Batman run in this.
AlexParkerDC	713572719883845633	2016-03-26T03:46:08	Does Batman have to be a vengeful jerk?

AlexParkerDC	713548523749376000	2016-03-26T02:09:59	There was a semi-positive Gigli review on Salon which was eaten by the Internet.
AlexParkerDC	713548253518815233	2016-03-26T02:08:55	BvS may be the worst-reviewed Affleck movie since Gigli, which is funny because some critics liked Gigli. 
AlexParkerDC	713546432876253189	2016-03-26T02:01:41	DRBCH When I heard it announced it seemed interesting, but not well-executed. Seems like Batman's been fighting crime to petty for Supes.
AlexParkerDC	713545195917336577	2016-03-26T01:56:46	Oh, there are lines of dialogue stating that Gotham is kind of a crummy place. That's it.
AlexParkerDC	713545095056855044	2016-03-26T01:56:22	Of BatmanvSuperman's sins, what bugs me the most is there isn't any real attempt to demonstrate that Metropolis &amp; Gotham are different.

AlexParkerDC	713469181979713536	2016-03-25T20:54:43	A sex scandal seems kind of quaint today, like a "POW!" graphic in the middle of Batman v. Superman's final act.
AlexParkerDC	713468204044181504	2016-03-25T20:50:50	Literally every hour of this day has been dumber than the one before
AlexParkerDC	713426847011307520	2016-03-25T18:06:29	ConsultReid Huh. I assume that has something to do with it being filmed in Michigan?
AlexParkerDC	713423913099853824	2016-03-25T17:54:50	ConsultReid I missed this--was Stabenow in the hearing scene?
AlexParkerDC	713420560068435972	2016-03-25T17:41:30	Typically talk of libel lawsuits in a campaign in nonsense, but I wouldn't be surprised if there actually are a few when '16 is done.
AlexParkerDC	713418677232623616	2016-03-25T17:34:01	You cannot acknowledge Batman's motives and anguish unless there is a giant mechanical dinosaur in the Batcave. 
AlexParkerDC	713418263376576514	2016-03-25T17:32:23	. ZackSnyder, like his predecessors, continues to violate the meaning of Batman canon by omitting the Batcave T-Rex

AlexParkerDC	713411221043720192	2016-03-25T17:04:24	Commentators continue to edit out stuff Trump says in an effort to try to understand him.
AlexParkerDC	713410886304718848	2016-03-25T17:03:04	This, tho, is incorrect--Trump has advocated a high tariff on Chinese imports. Talks about it a lot. jonathanchait 
AlexParkerDC	713410642548498432	2016-03-25T17:02:06	Interesting notion from jonathanchait:  
AlexParkerDC	713400059971444736	2016-03-25T16:20:03	emilcDC I didn't mind the concept as much as how overwrought it was.
AlexParkerDC	713399162713333764	2016-03-25T16:16:29	nickconfessore It can be wonderful that way. But the way it breaks down info into its smallest bits can be reinforcing to biases.
AlexParkerDC	713398627692109825	2016-03-25T16:14:21	I've been thinking about that too. The Internet is a giant proportion-destroying machine. 
AlexParkerDC	713394738150424577	2016-03-25T15:58:54	emilcDC Thematically it's supposed to fit. A fallen world, etc.
AlexParkerDC	713394253406281728	2016-03-25T15:56:58	emilcDC I mean, the movie doesn't even seem to think it's weird. It's just expected that this world would have a Batman.
AlexParkerDC	713393732998021120	2016-03-25T15:54:54	There's no explanation in BvS for why Bruce thought dressing up as a bat would be a good idea.
AlexParkerDC	713392149614751745	2016-03-25T15:48:37	. OrrChris is not kind to BatmanvSuperman: 
AlexParkerDC	713387339024883713	2016-03-25T15:29:30	Rschooley Also, in this campaign, is philandering really even a scandal?
AlexParkerDC	713386162753257472	2016-03-25T15:24:49	Rschooley Such as?
AlexParkerDC	713385973791461376	2016-03-25T15:24:04	Like if I took a pic or video of your face while you were just typing or something, I'm sure it would look funny.
AlexParkerDC	713385732639948800	2016-03-25T15:23:07	What do we call the Internet genre of over-reading people's facial reactions?
AlexParkerDC	713385200571559937	2016-03-25T15:21:00	By all accounts, Affleck took the "Gigli" reaction hard, he can't be happy with how people are talking about BvS.
AlexParkerDC	713384844756197376	2016-03-25T15:19:35	Gotta take the National Enquirer seriously, they got a story right once seven years ago.

AlexParkerDC	713243607147352064	2016-03-25T05:58:22	Unlike so many Batfans, I don't have this set idea of what Batman should be. I just want something that feels. &amp; to a degree, Baffleck felt.
AlexParkerDC	713240993617862656	2016-03-25T05:47:58	MikeDrewWhat They're why I fell in love with Batman in the first place.
AlexParkerDC	713239825885831168	2016-03-25T05:43:20	Batman watching his franchise: 
AlexParkerDC	713239466257883137	2016-03-25T05:41:54	There should be another Catwoman movie.
AlexParkerDC	713239192692719616	2016-03-25T05:40:49	MikeDrewWhat BvS I'm still processing--better than people are saying, IMHO.
AlexParkerDC	713239074090389505	2016-03-25T05:40:21	MikeDrewWhat I meant in general--not sure how I'd rank all superhero movies. I love the Nolan, Burton Batmovies.
AlexParkerDC	713238873703362561	2016-03-25T05:39:33	The very early Batman was very clearly influenced by Dracula: 
AlexParkerDC	713238684003397632	2016-03-25T05:38:48	MikeDrewWhat I can't say, just always has been to me. Part of it is that Batman feels like a whole genre, not just a character.
AlexParkerDC	713238339973996545	2016-03-25T05:37:26	MikeDrewWhat Those were good movies. (Except 3). Maybe my favorites behind the Batmovies.
AlexParkerDC	713237983680401408	2016-03-25T05:36:01	MikeDrewWhat I always thought that's what made Batman different--he just does this thing he has to do. Maybe it's good, maybe it's bad.
AlexParkerDC	713237815404990464	2016-03-25T05:35:21	MikeDrewWhat I just know the movies, where he's making this choice to accept this awesome responsibility, to his own detriment.
AlexParkerDC	713237021037301760	2016-03-25T05:32:11	MikeDrewWhat I've thought a lot about this. In regards to Spider-Man too. Who is really acting heroic?
AlexParkerDC	713236436351377408	2016-03-25T05:29:52	Is there a reliable metric by which one would measure the popularity of fictional characters? For a friend.
AlexParkerDC	713236202162401280	2016-03-25T05:28:56	MikeDrewWhat E.g., Wayne's trauma turned him into who he is, whereas Kent realizes he has powers &amp; chooses to act on them.
AlexParkerDC	713236007576014848	2016-03-25T05:28:10	MikeDrewWhat The way I interpret what you're saying is that Batman acts more out of compulsion, while Superman acts more out of reason.
AlexParkerDC	713234628908331008	2016-03-25T05:22:41	MikeDrewWhat I saw that, and I think Matt has a point. I think he meant the version of Wayne that is presented to the public.
AlexParkerDC	713234102053433344	2016-03-25T05:20:35	Eh, should be "crime-fighting," not "crime-righting," tho what a fascinating typo.
AlexParkerDC	713233872218112002	2016-03-25T05:19:41	I'm still chewing on whether, in BvS, Batman's 20-year crime-righting enterprise seems real, or just something the writers say happened.
AlexParkerDC	713233665124392960	2016-03-25T05:18:51	Ebert said that 1 thing he liked about "Iron Man" is that his company seemed like it really existed, not just "cooked up for the occasion."
AlexParkerDC	713232937672695808	2016-03-25T05:15:58	StarkTTT And TDK is the best movie of any of these we're talking about, IMHO.
AlexParkerDC	713232799185154052	2016-03-25T05:15:25	StarkTTT Well, that is counterintuitive. I liked the Baffleck more than I thought I would but not anywhere close to that.
AlexParkerDC	713231763414376448	2016-03-25T05:11:18	StarkTTT This one--TDK?
AlexParkerDC	713230881343856640	2016-03-25T05:07:47	Affleck is a better Bruce Wayne than Batman.
AlexParkerDC	713227638748348416	2016-03-25T04:54:54	What DC discovered--the only way to make Batman work in this age of overwrought CGI is to turn him into Iron Man.
AlexParkerDC	713227235721945088	2016-03-25T04:53:18	
AlexParkerDC	713222981451911168	2016-03-25T04:36:24	GailSimone Honestly baffled by the negative buzz for Jesse, I thought he was good--but I have no idea what Lex was trying to do.
AlexParkerDC	713222489460109312	2016-03-25T04:34:27	Updated BatMovie rankings, subject to change upon reflection:  1. TDK 2. '89 3. Returns 4. BB 5. TDKR 6. BvS 7. '66 8. Forever 9. &amp;Robin
AlexParkerDC	713220062505746432	2016-03-25T04:24:48	So wait--Jena Molane isn't in BatmanvSuperman in any freaking role--Robin, Batgirl, whatever.
AlexParkerDC	713218809704943616	2016-03-25T04:19:49	Folks who say that Chris Nolan doesn't understand people--I present to you....the Snyder-verse.
AlexParkerDC	713218575687876608	2016-03-25T04:18:54	mipolitico Looking like it. This Snyder-verse is just a totally different galaxy.
AlexParkerDC	713217870579310592	2016-03-25T04:16:05	Justin_A_Rick I actually loved TPM when it came out, despite the negative buzz--attribute it to youthful exuberance.
AlexParkerDC	713217571173040132	2016-03-25T04:14:54	mipolitico I liked it. TDK just set the bar so high, was bound to be a disappointment. Tried to outdo it, rather than do something diff.
AlexParkerDC	713216814180868096	2016-03-25T04:11:54	Which is why TDKR was a missed opportunity--Nolan coulda been like "We're doing it this way," &amp; WB execs woulda been like "yessir."
AlexParkerDC	713216496785301504	2016-03-25T04:10:38	And no, I don't know what the freaking parademons are.
AlexParkerDC	713216432906051584	2016-03-25T04:10:23	I kind of liked this, just because of how freaking gonzo it was. 
AlexParkerDC	713215849813815296	2016-03-25T04:08:04	Also, honest to god, I think this was the first time I ever thought of Luthor as SCARY. Several times people in the audience gasped at him.
AlexParkerDC	713215862564601856	2016-03-25T04:08:07	JoshZ2012 bendreyfuss Bale was right for the movie, but never quite made an impression vs. the villains. But that's always true for Bats.
AlexParkerDC	713215641210191873	2016-03-25T04:07:14	There might be a great noir or period Batman flick to be made, but can't, the character's too big now. 
AlexParkerDC	713215122316009472	2016-03-25T04:05:10	Man, there was a lot of movie with some guys who are mad or something then WONDER WOMAN shows up!
AlexParkerDC	713214781176594432	2016-03-25T04:03:49	petersuderman I still don't understand what Luthor was trying to do.
AlexParkerDC	713213955120955392	2016-03-25T04:00:32	justkarl And Pat Leahy, it turns out. Tho if they do sequels he might not be able to do any more Batcameos...
AlexParkerDC	713213626203705345	2016-03-25T03:59:14	bendreyfuss Nicholson is what pulls it ahead for me, I put it just behind TDK. But Returns is good too.
AlexParkerDC	713211792391016448	2016-03-25T03:51:56	Meant to say "as close to the perfect Batman movie as been made" here.

AlexParkerDC	711798763552120832	2016-03-21T06:17:04	I'm not saying it's a bad movie, you just have to appreciate it now more as one of those over-the-top things from the 90s, like impeachment.
AlexParkerDC	711798442641723392	2016-03-21T06:15:47	JTuckerAnimator Yep, and other storylines. Hard to think of Penguin and *not* think of a politician now. Another example.
AlexParkerDC	711797915342270465	2016-03-21T06:13:42	JTuckerAnimator The "Hizzoner the Penguin" arc is great political satire, IMHO.

AlexParkerDC	711794665419358208	2016-03-21T06:00:47	JTuckerAnimator Maybe self-parody is the wrong word, I just mean it had sort of a wink...
AlexParkerDC	711793761542656000	2016-03-21T05:57:11	JTuckerAnimator Like why is Batgirl so much more popular than Batwoman? I think it's because of the show.
AlexParkerDC	711793653870698496	2016-03-21T05:56:46	JTuckerAnimator What I find fascinating is that the show did so much to define the canon afterwards, even after it got more dark.
AlexParkerDC	711791470341128196	2016-03-21T05:48:05	JTuckerAnimator Don't mean self-parody in a bad way.
AlexParkerDC	711791325448949760	2016-03-21T05:47:31	JTuckerAnimator At that point it was more self-parody though, right? At least seems like it today.

AlexParkerDC	709938128002359297	2016-03-16T03:03:34	The GOP's rules are designed to protect the front-runner. This is like when Jodie Foster realized she was trapped in the panic room.
AlexParkerDC	709930071822372864	2016-03-16T02:31:33	And to a large degree, inversions are about taking U.S. income and moving it off-shore, thru earnings stripping.
AlexParkerDC	709929621219909632	2016-03-16T02:29:46	It's a somewhat subtle point, but you can't just go out and get it. Inverting lets you get *future* overseas profits.
AlexParkerDC	709929480282894336	2016-03-16T02:29:12	Another thing--Trump keeps saying company's invert to get their overseas money. Not exactly.
AlexParkerDC	709927415133442050	2016-03-16T02:21:00	That said, it's not an altogether horrible idea--if there were a fiscally responsible way to get the U.S. corp. rate to 15%.
AlexParkerDC	709927286951305216	2016-03-16T02:20:29	This is because U.S. corps would pay the foreign country's 15%--then get it fully refunded thru a foreign tax credit from Treasury.
AlexParkerDC	709926413260988416	2016-03-16T02:17:01	With a 15% worldwide tax, Trump's plan would essentially encourage countries to set their rates at 15% and let Treasury fund their gov't.
AlexParkerDC	709925585557004289	2016-03-16T02:13:44	Lewandowski thought Trump's comment about "disgusting reporters" was hilarious
AlexParkerDC	709924601271287808	2016-03-16T02:09:49	mattyglesias Which part?
AlexParkerDC	709924300934012928	2016-03-16T02:08:37	Trump keeps saying corporate inversions cost the U.S. jobs. They actually don't. 
AlexParkerDC	709924111062065153	2016-03-16T02:07:52	You know who Lewandowski worked for before Trump? (Koch Brothers.)
AlexParkerDC	709923666306473984	2016-03-16T02:06:06	Trump keeps talking about inversions--but some tax experts think his tax plan would accelerate them.
AlexParkerDC	709923254853566464	2016-03-16T02:04:28	I actually think he's kind of cogent on it--he's right that both parties pretty much agree. 
AlexParkerDC	709922886564356096	2016-03-16T02:03:00	Well, he says "there's no way to bring it back." Of course there is. They companies could repatriate it and pay the taxes.
AlexParkerDC	709922718494400512	2016-03-16T02:02:20	Trump's riff on overseas money is essentially correct.
AlexParkerDC	709919561764753408	2016-03-16T01:49:47	If you’re interested in what Bernie Sanders has to say (MSNBC, CNN and Fox are not), CSPAN has his speech: 
AlexParkerDC	709919188060602368	2016-03-16T01:48:18	In Ohio, Trump basically winning Appalachia, the part that's basically Kentucky, + Youngstown.
AlexParkerDC	709916655426609153	2016-03-16T01:38:14	Trump wins Illinois.
AlexParkerDC	709914340846149632	2016-03-16T01:29:03	Max_Fisher O'Malley gets some attention too.
AlexParkerDC	709911887979417602	2016-03-16T01:19:18	Now *Kasich* getting heckled?

AlexParkerDC	709907527622926337	2016-03-16T01:01:58	Ohio is surprisingly not Michigan at all.  
AlexParkerDC	709907661987442689	2016-03-16T01:02:30	And, now that the big races have been called, some entertainment for the rest of the night... 
AlexParkerDC	709906948330819584	2016-03-16T00:59:40	Wow, Hillary crushing both the Rust Belt and Appalachia parts of Ohio.  
AlexParkerDC	709904843461103616	2016-03-16T00:51:18	For once, Trump's instincts were off. He waited too long to go after Kasich, really bang the NAFTA drum.
AlexParkerDC	709904597519900672	2016-03-16T00:50:20	Kasich wins Ohio!

AlexParkerDC	709466799797051392	2016-03-14T19:50:40	In the Trumpverse, it's idiots in DC who are the bad guys, giving U.S. corps incentives to move abroad, which they quite reasonably follow.

AlexParkerDC	709465708007182336	2016-03-14T19:46:20	I think this line of critique sort of misunderstands Trump's pitch, and his appeal. 
AlexParkerDC	709454532548276224	2016-03-14T19:01:56	Again: Free yourselves, GOP, of the notion that 2016 is salvageable. It's liberating and clarifying about the course before you.

AlexParkerDC	709443153741352960	2016-03-14T18:16:43	A lot of Trump analysis is like that.

AlexParkerDC	709439776999542784	2016-03-14T18:03:18	If the GOP basically disowns its nominee Trump, it might be helpful to have a SCOTUS seat in play to motivate turnout in Senate races.
AlexParkerDC	709438935857020928	2016-03-14T17:59:57	I seriously can't keep up with how fast the goalposts move on whether or not NeverTrump is genuine. 
AlexParkerDC	709437766124367872	2016-03-14T17:55:18	Is it possible that Trump is both the warlord from Mad Max, and also the person who causes the apocalypse in it?

AlexParkerDC	709430722432536576	2016-03-14T17:27:19	No joke, every other die-hard Trump supporter I meet in Ohio is a middle-aged or late-middle-aged person who's NEVER voted before.

AlexParkerDC	709430331787636736	2016-03-14T17:25:46	Just a gut feeling, but I think Trump miscalculated with Ohio. Didn't start trying to tie Kasich to NAFTA until much too late.
AlexParkerDC	709429770891759616	2016-03-14T17:23:32	I've seen that happen in Congressional races before, what about a governor or senator candidate?
AlexParkerDC	709429633243029505	2016-03-14T17:22:59	Is there a precedent in modern politics for a party nominee getting no or minimal support from his own party?
AlexParkerDC	709417284465528832	2016-03-14T16:33:55	This is a simple, clear way of making a point others have tried to get at less successfully.

AlexParkerDC	709196819084025856	2016-03-14T01:57:52	One of those aspects is that groups seem to live in entirely different realities, making national narratives basically irreconcilable.
