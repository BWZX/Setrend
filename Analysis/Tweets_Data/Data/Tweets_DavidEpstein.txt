DavidEpstein	693485583491055616	2016-01-30T17:27:02	DrMJoyner ok, running time...probably for us both. Till next time! Good discussion
DavidEpstein	693485236164902913	2016-01-30T17:25:39	DrMJoyner it's good stuff, but I think caution appropriate if extrapolating to other traits,populations,or even families
DavidEpstein	693484865178705920	2016-01-30T17:24:10	DrMJoyner fair enough.But also u could have a thousand families w/HCM and no 2 w/same causative gene. Layers of complexity are staggering
DavidEpstein	693480789535801344	2016-01-30T17:07:59	DrMJoyner I think you conflate well-placed criticism of hype and wasted resources with actual proof of what's occuring in nature
DavidEpstein	693479338679730180	2016-01-30T17:02:13	DrMJoyner mackinprof semantics
DavidEpstein	693477872695185408	2016-01-30T16:56:23	DrMJoyner mackinprof oh brother. No,back to basic research methods.Turns out people inherited DNA even before we knew what it was
DavidEpstein	693477576912867328	2016-01-30T16:55:13	mackinprof DrMJoyner haha, enjoy!
DavidEpstein	693477496025649153	2016-01-30T16:54:53	DrMJoyner mackinprof apply this rigor to signal you detect by intuition in Minneapolis, which is the polar opposite of random assignment
DavidEpstein	693477235248988160	2016-01-30T16:53:51	DrMJoyner mackinprof no, only because you're making it so.Whether we ever detected a genome at all has zip to do w/truth of inheritance
DavidEpstein	693476956562661376	2016-01-30T16:52:45	mackinprof DrMJoyner I feel you, for sure. it's a problem. they are wrong. It still doesn't bear on the ultimate truth
DavidEpstein	693476715616690176	2016-01-30T16:51:47	DrMJoyner mackinprof no, you really don't. Seven footers. Please explain. Oh...
DavidEpstein	693476326880198656	2016-01-30T16:50:15	mackinprof DrMJoyner i just think that's a completely diff argument, about value, as opposed to about the truth of nature
DavidEpstein	693476209817174016	2016-01-30T16:49:47	mackinprof DrMJoyner those are totally different issues. whether worth detecting vs. whether it's in the genome at all
DavidEpstein	693475908481630209	2016-01-30T16:48:35	DrMJoyner mackinprof yeah, I mean, same for all of psychology it turns out. not saying we should do the work,but it ain't proof of absence
DavidEpstein	693475602091892738	2016-01-30T16:47:22	mackinprof DrMJoyner totally agree. And think it suggests misplaced resources in much work,but still is nothing akin to proof of absence
DavidEpstein	693475070728130566	2016-01-30T16:45:15	mackinprof DrMJoyner I 100% agree with that, and would in fact say it's proven (with a few known very rare exceptional cases)
DavidEpstein	693474268760412161	2016-01-30T16:42:04	mackinprof DrMJoyner the size of the sample, or effect size of any given variation has zero to do with overall variance due to DNA
DavidEpstein	693474032625278976	2016-01-30T16:41:08	mackinprof DrMJoyner that is absolutely not solid logic. Are you saying variance explained by DNA for height is also small then?
DavidEpstein	693462344916168704	2016-01-30T15:54:41	This by DownhillWriter is a great portrait of an inimitable moment in US sports history

DavidEpstein	693234090221379584	2016-01-30T00:47:41	DrMJoyner agreed
DavidEpstein	693231862110617600	2016-01-30T00:38:50	DrMJoyner but tell me under what definition of gene height isn't genetic. And yet, it's missing
DavidEpstein	693231260731363332	2016-01-30T00:36:26	DrMJoyner never mind genes at all. Sequence variation, looking only at genes is limiting
DavidEpstein	693217918436384768	2016-01-29T23:43:25	DrMJoyner and still the variants needn't be the same. Height, HCM, damn near everything. Are u saying this is proof those aren't genetic?
DavidEpstein	693217557004861440	2016-01-29T23:41:59	nir_eynon DrMJoyner PLOSONE it can't say there isn't common profile, only not common profile of large effect variants
DavidEpstein	693217370249248769	2016-01-29T23:41:15	DrMJoyner yep, but doesn't mean anything about underpowered study not finding variants. There ARE others with Finnotype, but unknown why
DavidEpstein	693213154323595265	2016-01-29T23:24:29	DrMJoyner also, endophenotypic heterogeneity...like HCM, lotta ways to get to the same place
DavidEpstein	693212632791281664	2016-01-29T23:22:25	DrMJoyner why? completely depends on variant effect size. O2 transport is multifaceted,could be millions of small variations, again like ht
DavidEpstein	693211269046865920	2016-01-29T23:17:00	DrMJoyner the rarity of the phenotype doesn't matter. Find me 7-footer genes
DavidEpstein	693210099221970944	2016-01-29T23:12:21	Excellent! Kid adjusted tennis courts 
DavidEpstein	693207756392812544	2016-01-29T23:03:02	DrMJoyner but I agree I think this is true, but they haven't shown it.
DavidEpstein	693206405558489089	2016-01-29T22:57:40	DrMJoyner here's the conclusion study: we don't have enough subjects to find anything except enormous effect genes nobody thinks exist
DavidEpstein	693205955526447105	2016-01-29T22:55:53	DrMJoyner study is vastly underpowered to say that. But wouldn't expect same across ethnicity anyway
