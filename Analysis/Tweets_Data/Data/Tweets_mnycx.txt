mnycx	690172640393347073	2016-01-21T14:02:34	In EURUSD Binary at 1.0789. Again 20min expiration, again €2K risk.
mnycx	690166527950241792	2016-01-21T13:38:17	Mario Dragqueen hates EURUSD …1.078’s now from 1.092’s. Ouch.
mnycx	690165335677345792	2016-01-21T13:33:33	EURUSD ouch.
mnycx	690159615091294208	2016-01-21T13:10:49	And this GBPUSD Binary trade worked out. Quick €1620 profit in 20 min. 
mnycx	690154532530212864	2016-01-21T12:50:37	In GBPUSD here for a bounce next 20min expiration. Probably stupid. Risking €2K. Attempting quick oversold bounce.
mnycx	690152288414011392	2016-01-21T12:41:42	GBPUSD is the new crude oil. Ouch.
mnycx	690147991294984194	2016-01-21T12:24:38	mnycx also twitter doesn't open bunch of APIs for these apps. tweetbot yet to get polls because jack won't allow.
mnycx	690147638851825664	2016-01-21T12:23:14	Weird how third party twitter apps roll out nice features faster than twitter itself. Tweetbot, Tweetings &amp; others had dark mode for ages.

mnycx	690131303912574977	2016-01-21T11:18:19	Really a shame all the negativity on Bitcoin in the past week didn’t push it lower. BTCUSD actually bounced from 345 to 420’ish.
mnycx	690128060063023104	2016-01-21T11:05:26	Gold/ Silver probably waiting for ECB to make the moves. On this daily SLV chart it’s perking above MA50 though: 
mnycx	690119700689350657	2016-01-21T10:32:13	/SI Silver probably ready to bounce on 15min chart. Same high probability setup example tweeted earlier.

mnycx	690111239687704576	2016-01-21T09:58:35	Trader_Dante tons of excitement but you don’t trade FX Binaries. If you’re bored, open a IG account and so some ‚Sprint Markets‘ :)
mnycx	690084505231691776	2016-01-21T08:12:21	Example high probability Binary Options trade see annotated image. EURUSD 15min chart w RSI red/ overbought. 
mnycx	690077121352450048	2016-01-21T07:43:01	thinkorswim on a more serious note: A candle timer/ counter of how much time a candle has left to close (like TradingView) would be nice

mnycx	689904079066103808	2016-01-20T20:15:24	Feature request for thinkorswim - Make chart windows transparent so you can watch movies (not porn of course) with candlesticks on top
mnycx	689896595622662144	2016-01-20T19:45:40	So don’t tell a trader to ‚grow some balls‘. Tell him to cut them off.
mnycx	689896377493671936	2016-01-20T19:44:48	Maybe having no balls would make you a better trader. Testosterone can influence you negatively for objective performance.
mnycx	689888786138816512	2016-01-20T19:14:38	mnycx I saw a solid support at $0 ... Still holding all year

mnycx	689882768071852034	2016-01-20T18:50:43	Stupid rumors, hopefully not true.    
mnycx	689879186270490624	2016-01-20T18:36:29	TWTR 18’s squeezing.
mnycx	689872096743264256	2016-01-20T18:08:19	You should do 2-4min planks in between trading or every few hours. Good for the abs and circulation. 
mnycx	689868913220435968	2016-01-20T17:55:40	Hell freezes over. TWTR green.
mnycx	689863740175601666	2016-01-20T17:35:07	. NicTrades yeah I can see SPY bouncing off 180’s where it did in August. Question is how much.
mnycx	689862318323277824	2016-01-20T17:29:28	PipCzar so what for are the charts and lines then? :P
mnycx	689861969256542210	2016-01-20T17:28:05	PipCzar so what are you doing, are you buying here then?
mnycx	689857133353967617	2016-01-20T17:08:52	PipCzar ah ok, I had /CLG6 up. Oh and let’s see. It didn’t care about the 161.8% Fib couple bucks higher, lol.
mnycx	689853681659940864	2016-01-20T16:55:09	PipCzar 26.5 now and lower
mnycx	689843091084316672	2016-01-20T16:13:04	Every day I see a new bunch of brave T/A soldiers drawing support lines on crude oil:

mnycx	689839995994128384	2016-01-20T16:00:46	Are we entering the ‚even Cramer doesn’t know what to do‘ territory? SPY SPX 
mnycx	689837100183715840	2016-01-20T15:49:15	It cost $25M to produce.    
mnycx	689835736976199681	2016-01-20T15:43:50	ChartLearning are you leaving twitter? No point following you if you’re done.

mnycx	689822142767218690	2016-01-20T14:49:49	ivanhoff traderstewie this could be the bounce play of the year (at least a 100% of current levels) unless they’re going bankrupt.
mnycx	689820893418254336	2016-01-20T14:44:51	TWTR going to $10 seems be coming sooner than expected. If there is a buyout this year I hope it’s Google and not Facebook.
