daytrend	715141299024728064	2016-03-30T11:39:07	8) But his policy of largely self-funding without strings attached is one of his most valuable policies. Think about it.
daytrend	715140710614237184	2016-03-30T11:36:46	7) .... So you have to learn and evaluated his intended policies. That is not easy in every case.
