politicalmath	711304803813470208	2016-03-19T21:34:15	This is unfair. Most people care about truth, even if they are incurious when they see stuff confirming their priors

politicalmath	711211429487980545	2016-03-19T15:23:13	It makes me sad to realize Scalia probably would have sided with Gawker. He was a powerful pro 1st amd voice  
politicalmath	710966280593932288	2016-03-18T23:09:05	Here is my tear of compassion for Gawker. 💧 (not to scale, enlarged for clarity)
politicalmath	711204580839727104	2016-03-19T14:56:00	People linking the "GOP ruined Kansas" piece ask so few questions about the data, I have to conclude they don't care about truth.

politicalmath	710976765771046912	2016-03-18T23:50:44	Rights have to be defended with total conviction even when they're invoked by people you don't like. We've forgotten that and it sucks.
politicalmath	710977513133051905	2016-03-18T23:53:43	That the left has become so comfortable with eroding basic rights will be disastrous for us in time. They'll always come for us eventually.

politicalmath	710973281491243008	2016-03-18T23:36:54	LA_Banker In a piece on the GOP disdain &amp; detachment, it shows the exact same disdain and detachment
politicalmath	710972396555997184	2016-03-18T23:33:23	In theory, we should defend Gawker In practice, we've abandoned the idea that awful people should have rights
politicalmath	710970617441325056	2016-03-18T23:26:19	LA_Banker What possible value did that joke add, other than to say "I thought of a pun and have no self-control"?
politicalmath	710970456380014592	2016-03-18T23:25:40	LA_Banker Serious enough to call it serious. Not serious enough to refrain from a totally unnecessary Marx joke.

politicalmath	710966569908588545	2016-03-18T23:10:14	Is it possible, maybe even likely, that if Gawker was not run by assholes, they would have won this?

politicalmath	710875674567835650	2016-03-18T17:09:02	futuraprime It's way past the margin of error and its just. So. Weird. Never found a compelling explanation for it. Just guesses.
politicalmath	710875174837592064	2016-03-18T17:07:03	futuraprime and the current one (damn account mixups!) 
politicalmath	710874859790667776	2016-03-18T17:05:48	futuraprime hard to explain on twitter, but here's the year-over-year job improvement in early 2000's 
politicalmath	710874481237987328	2016-03-18T17:04:18	futuraprime the 2002-2006 recovery looked far better from CPS point of view, this one better from CES
politicalmath	710873568796479488	2016-03-18T17:00:40	futuraprime I'm trying to pull the s but it *seems* like fewer self-employed &amp; small firms (as captured by CPS but not CES)
politicalmath	710872911691653120	2016-03-18T16:58:04	futuraprime Since 2002, the gap between the CPS and the CES number has almost doubled
politicalmath	710870496619835392	2016-03-18T16:48:28	futuraprime It's the CPS survey, not the CES one. The discrepancy between the two over the last 5 years has been freakish.
politicalmath	710870010298650624	2016-03-18T16:46:32	futuraprime nevertheless the point remains: The "GOP needs to account for these policies" is not a clean story. It's far more complicated
politicalmath	710869570538442753	2016-03-18T16:44:47	futuraprime The most recent one has tLA down 1% since then, but also has Kansas jobs sky-rocketing.
politicalmath	710869369425829888	2016-03-18T16:43:59	futuraprime I'm looking at a data pull on Louisiana from 6 months ago, when they were at 3% employment growth since 2008.
politicalmath	710867819697557504	2016-03-18T16:37:50	futuraprime That is really weird. I'm 89% sure that isn't what the BLS says. Let me check.
politicalmath	710867147673575424	2016-03-18T16:35:09	2) but job growth in TX is national policy but job growth in CO is state policy but job growth in UT in national policy
politicalmath	710866786409787392	2016-03-18T16:33:43	1) And now the liberals who claim job growth in LA is Obama but poor job growth in Kansas is Brownback but growth in CA is state policy
politicalmath	710866418053488640	2016-03-18T16:32:15	DigitalNeal Ah. so you're saying that the article should be attacking Obama for the lack of jobs in Kansas?
politicalmath	710866095121440768	2016-03-18T16:30:58	danielwinlander No. But you can download the data (up until April 2015) here - Lab 3 - end 
politicalmath	710865604303978496	2016-03-18T16:29:01	futuraprime But... even so. It's *worth mentioning*. If he grappled w/ it, that would be one thing. But he just ignores it.
politicalmath	710865451870347264	2016-03-18T16:28:25	futuraprime Since 2008, LA has matched CA and CO in job growth... which is impressive.
politicalmath	710865334811529216	2016-03-18T16:27:57	futuraprime Charting from 2006, yes but from 2008 onward, LA had pretty much the same recession hit everyone else had
politicalmath	710864944892223488	2016-03-18T16:26:24	6) The only reason I could call BS on it is b/c I keep a chart of employment in all 50 states on hand. B/c nerd 
politicalmath	710864514527268864	2016-03-18T16:24:42	5) I'm tired of this. I'm tired of not being able to trust what I read. I'm tired of smart people not asking the obvious questions.
politicalmath	710864247727632385	2016-03-18T16:23:38	4) This is who journalists apparently are now. Hacks who formulate hit pieces w/ half truths knowing most people can't research them.
politicalmath	710863966889594880	2016-03-18T16:22:31	3) So ericlevitz knew about Louisiana's jobs but left it out. This is not a person who grapples w/ truth but picks the bits he likes.
politicalmath	710863605604814848	2016-03-18T16:21:05	2) The author clearly knew Louisiana had great job growth &amp; consciously omitted it. Very simply: You can't trust them to tell you the truth.
politicalmath	710863159691620352	2016-03-18T16:19:19	1) Read the article &amp; pause. Ask "why did they mention jobs in Kansas but not Louisiana?" You already know the answer
politicalmath	710861511187533826	2016-03-18T16:12:46	And yet they were enacted in TX and things went great. Perhaps, then, this isn't the common thread. 
politicalmath	710850439932198912	2016-03-18T15:28:46	When Trump declared I said media shld ask "what did yr ppl find about Obama in Hawaii?" &amp; refuse to move on to anything else til he answered
politicalmath	710835483681619968	2016-03-18T14:29:20	I have a better idea. Let him run again as a Democrat. He can have the Republicans who like him. We don't want them.

politicalmath	708341132862709760	2016-03-11T17:17:41	JonHenke The Cruz allegations are similarly inaccurate. It's targeting the ignorant w/ a religion they don't understand to scare them.
politicalmath	708340602589450240	2016-03-11T17:15:34	JonHenke I'm uncomfortable w/ Catholic prayers to Mary. But writing a piece "Rubio worships Mary" is anti-Catholic
politicalmath	708339384064454656	2016-03-11T17:10:44	JonHenke there are Christian charismatics that *literally* anoint everyone in the church. It's not like saying "he's Jesus"
politicalmath	708334493103296512	2016-03-11T16:51:18	warforgedbard Wrong, according to the polls. but whatever aligns with your pre-conceived notions is what you'll believe.

politicalmath	708333207746285568	2016-03-11T16:46:11	So liberals can say "Trump is the GOP only noisier" and in the next breath they recognize Trump's policies are basically all Dem policies
politicalmath	708332755650674689	2016-03-11T16:44:23	But we've shifted from having ideals &amp; standards to the simple, almost neanderthal, act of rationalizing any action that supports our clan
politicalmath	708332433632919552	2016-03-11T16:43:07	Although "consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds" is also an adorable one that weak minded faux-intellectuals are fond of
politicalmath	708332061908553728	2016-03-11T16:41:38	We even have faux-wisdom to support our lack of shame &amp; integrity "So I contradict myself. I am large I contain multitudes" is my favorite

politicalmath	708330679646289921	2016-03-11T16:36:08	In the commie scare the epic protest line was "have you no sense of decency?" Now, that would be a laugh line.
politicalmath	708329958674792452	2016-03-11T16:33:16	The liberal line "Trump is just normal GOP but noisier" is a line that helps Trump. It is intended to help him. It is disgraceful.
politicalmath	708328787876847616	2016-03-11T16:28:37	JonHenke emzanotti the focus is on the verbiage. "Anointed one" and "speaking in tongues". People shrug off the "bibles in schools" stuff

politicalmath	708320461726179328	2016-03-11T15:55:32	JonHenke emzanotti and making it a big deal is totally anti-Christian. Like saying a Muslim candidate one said "Allahu Akbar"
politicalmath	708319889606356992	2016-03-11T15:53:16	JonHenke emzanotti if this hits the mainstream news cycle now, it looks to me like it was held until it could do the most damage to Cruz
politicalmath	708319615483387904	2016-03-11T15:52:10	JonHenke emzanotti AND it's normal *charismatic* stuff. Most states with charismatic populations have already voted

politicalmath	706348888450424832	2016-03-06T05:21:12	Honestly? Someone, either Rubio or Cruz, needs to say "Screw it Florida. Vote for the other guy" Soon.

politicalmath	706344778900766721	2016-03-06T05:04:53	casey3040 That's the tough thing. I think Rubio + Cruz might have a chance to beat him. Does one dropping out help? Maybe. But maybe not.

politicalmath	702973077617922048	2016-02-25T21:46:56	Trump will hire all the establishment consultants. They will swim in money while they laugh at us. 
politicalmath	702971521359175680	2016-02-25T21:40:45	Well... you weren't wrong

politicalmath	702945952131190784	2016-02-25T19:59:09	Awesome! MittRomney's anti-Trump efforts are rolling through my neighborhood 
politicalmath	702941961850789892	2016-02-25T19:43:18	Imagine if Rubio &amp; Cruz said that Trump was afraid of the truth &amp; called every truth teller a liar. Trump couldn't help himself.
politicalmath	702941491241484288	2016-02-25T19:41:26	Or a spoken one. In fact, if they're not meeting behind closed doors to strategize, they're crazy. 
politicalmath	702940542821269504	2016-02-25T19:37:40	petersuderman I'm convinced policy is nothing against Trump. Rubio or Cruz need to find the *people* he's screwed &amp; give them a platform
politicalmath	702939650550165505	2016-02-25T19:34:07	And the same for tedcruz. If you see Marco going after Trump &amp; you think "oh good, now I can beat up Marco" the election is over. You lose.
politicalmath	702939284731355136	2016-02-25T19:32:40	If the marcorubio team is listening: I'm not joking. My support for Rubio depends on him understanding that Trump is the target. Not Cruz.
politicalmath	702938960545222657	2016-02-25T19:31:22	There's a decent chance that Mitt Romney is richer than Donald Trump. Romney just doesn't lie about it. 
politicalmath	702938369450332160	2016-02-25T19:29:01	I'm a *big* fan of marcorubio, but if he doesn't attack Trump tonight, he doesn't understand what is going on in this election.

politicalmath	702934455107727360	2016-02-25T19:13:28	Here's my endorsement: I'll go with whoever hits Trump the hardest tonight. Also Kasich &amp; Carson, GTFO
