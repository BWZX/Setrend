WesleyLowery	723160473156247552	2016-04-21T14:44:27	MarlowNYC historically, many plagiarists have intended to pass others' work as their own. this seems obviously to be sloppiness, not that

WesleyLowery	723153471784914944	2016-04-21T14:16:37	johnvmoore i definitely would (just noting that i see his defensive response, and think back to many of mine to public criticism)
WesleyLowery	723153069119143937	2016-04-21T14:15:01	Kyle_Feldscher hard to imagine anyone fired if Daily Beast brought accusations to NYDN first, before creating twitter firestorm
