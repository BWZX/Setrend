mileskimball	705036745469890560	2016-03-02T14:27:13	cory__vernon This is much more mechanical. Cut in rates makes the deficit look smaller. So politicians can spend more w/o higher deficit.

mileskimball	705030006745878529	2016-03-02T14:00:27	ericlonners Mild negative rates with no decline in the paper currency interest rate is not a full-bore negative rate policy. MESandbu
mileskimball	705029424333221888	2016-03-02T13:58:08	ericlonners Such transfers from the government (including central bank) to households would tend to reduce government spending. MESandbu
mileskimball	705029119096918016	2016-03-02T13:56:55	ericlonners Government spending is higher because of low rates than it otherwise would be--but mostly because of wealth effect. MESandbu

mileskimball	705021210673881088	2016-03-02T13:25:29	ericlonners If present value of corporate earnings doesn't go up, then rates are high when money is put in the stock market. MESandbu

mileskimball	705018788073201664	2016-03-02T13:15:52	ericlonners You are still ignoring the wealth effects of low rates on the government. Lower deficits, more spending. MESandbu
mileskimball	705018445209862145	2016-03-02T13:14:30	ericlonners If stock markets stays low, then people can get high rates simply by investing in the stock market. MESandbu
mileskimball	705018189046874112	2016-03-02T13:13:29	ericlonners If a cut in rates had a negative wealth effect, then a rise in stock market would have a negative wealth effect. MESandbu
mileskimball	705018037812879360	2016-03-02T13:12:53	ericlonners Note that the stock market going up is a cut in rates for the stock market. MESandbu
mileskimball	705017870112063488	2016-03-02T13:12:13	ericlonners If the stock market doesn't go up, then the dividend/price ratio is higher and so returns are higher. MESandbu
mileskimball	705017487889342465	2016-03-02T13:10:42	ericlonners You are already assuming lower rates make people poorer. That is not settled-it is what we are discussing.  MESandbu

mileskimball	705014361706799104	2016-03-02T12:58:17	ericlonners The pitfall is thinking of all wealth as if it were T-bills. For fixed payout stream, all other forms of wealth go up in PDV.
mileskimball	705014028486074368	2016-03-02T12:56:57	ericlonners To first approx, payout flows don't change: higher present values and lower returns on those higher present values. MESandbu
mileskimball	705013719609143297	2016-03-02T12:55:43	ericlonners Lower rates raise, not lower the present discounted value of lifetime income. MESandbu
mileskimball	705013547961421824	2016-03-02T12:55:03	ericlonners Note that present discounted value of both taxes and government spending are going up too before any change in path. MESandbu
mileskimball	705013142661672962	2016-03-02T12:53:26	ericlonners MESandbu Lower rates raise the present discounted value of both lifetime income and the present discounted cost of consumption
mileskimball	705012890353336320	2016-03-02T12:52:26	ericlonners MESandbu If capital continues to get 1/3 of GDP &amp; labor 2/3, before accounting for expansion of GDP,  payouts same.
mileskimball	705012519987875841	2016-03-02T12:50:57	ericlonners Thus, changes in present value of consumption due to rates must be cancelled out by changes in present value of payouts.
mileskimball	705012164709384193	2016-03-02T12:49:33	ericlonners Consumption in initial equilibrium must come from payouts (labor income, dividends). So timing of consumption = payout timing
mileskimball	705011814120050688	2016-03-02T12:48:09	ericlonners Remember that higher equity requirements for banks make bank stock go down, but positive wealth effect for taxpayer. MESandbu
mileskimball	705011528513130496	2016-03-02T12:47:01	ericlonners Negative rates are not the only thing at work. Trump is and should be scary to equity markets. MESandbu
mileskimball	705010791905243136	2016-03-02T12:44:05	ericlonners When rates cut, either long-term nature of borrowing blunts effect, or government or firms who owe have positive wealth effect.
mileskimball	705010549713534976	2016-03-02T12:43:08	ericlonners Those who have resources to spend more than labor income + social security are owed money by government and firms.
mileskimball	705010301255585792	2016-03-02T12:42:08	ericlonners For people who just spend their labor income every month, rate wealth effects cancel. Not perceiving wealth effect is correct.
mileskimball	705009577805230080	2016-03-02T12:39:16	ericlonners MESandbu Any longer-term asset--including human capital, goes up in present value when interest rates fall. Key effect.
mileskimball	705009377934077952	2016-03-02T12:38:28	ericlonners MESandbu The typical analysis is often done as if all assets were in 3-month T-bills.
mileskimball	705009143350849536	2016-03-02T12:37:32	ericlonners No. The timing of the payouts from the assets make a huge difference. Human capital has payouts far into the future. MESandbu

mileskimball	705004385936388097	2016-03-02T12:18:38	ericlonners The principle that, by and large, all the wealth effects together must cancel helps in searching for all the wealth effects.
mileskimball	705004054200463360	2016-03-02T12:17:19	ericlonners Sometimes it is a little hard to see some of the wealth effects. The changing present value of labor income is a good example.
mileskimball	705003904535166977	2016-03-02T12:16:43	ericlonners Thanks! Key principle: aside from overall expansion of economy + interactions with MPC differences--wealth effects cancel
mileskimball	705003574019772416	2016-03-02T12:15:25	ericlonners A key effect is that the present discounted value of labor income goes up.

mileskimball	695642381702537216	2016-02-05T16:17:22	Federalist_10 South Africa is a good example of an economy harmed by high wage floors (not all exactly "minimum wages").
mileskimball	695642133718560768	2016-02-05T16:16:23	Federalist_10 Denmark has one of the most flexible set of labor market rules in Europe. And their labor productivity is quite high.
mileskimball	695641002250498048	2016-02-05T16:11:53	Federalist_10 For the continental US, the minimum wage has been low enough you have to look to teens, minorities &amp; handicapped for the harm
mileskimball	695640674637635584	2016-02-05T16:10:35	Federalist_10 But in an international context, all those effects are small invariance compared to other things affecting productivity.
mileskimball	695640501391904768	2016-02-05T16:09:54	Federalist_10 The minimum wage can lead firms to require workers to work at a faster pace, raising productivity.
mileskimball	695640356868722688	2016-02-05T16:09:20	Federalist_10 The minimum wage can lead firms to replace workers by capital. The capital raises the productivity of the remaining workers.
mileskimball	695640089616056320	2016-02-05T16:08:16	Federalist_10 The minimum wage can shut low-productivity workers out and so make productivity look better *among those who still have jobs*
mileskimball	695639919004356608	2016-02-05T16:07:35	mileskimball Yes, most of the variance of the level of productivity is independent of the minimum wage. Federalist_10

mileskimball	695638168721362944	2016-02-05T16:00:38	Federalist_10 In many places in the US the unconstrained wage is above the minimum wage and we see it directly.
mileskimball	695638094612205569	2016-02-05T16:00:20	Federalist_10 No. The US is different because of higher productivity.
mileskimball	695637918816346112	2016-02-05T15:59:38	Federalist_10 A strong argument can be made for *non*-pecuniary externalities of the 40-hour work week. Not so for the minimum wage.
mileskimball	695637618948706304	2016-02-05T15:58:27	Federalist_10 Child labor is someone (parents) making someone else work (children). That isn't free labor at all.
mileskimball	695637254858006528	2016-02-05T15:57:00	Federalist_10 Making a good estimate of what wages would be in absence of the minimum wage would not be that hard. Labor economists can do.
mileskimball	695636995893239808	2016-02-05T15:55:58	Federalist_10 It isn't about Puerto Rico being a a small island. It is about a minimum wage that is high relative to labor productivity.
mileskimball	695636468417634305	2016-02-05T15:53:53	Federalist_10 I don't see the need for too many qualifiers. A low minimum wage is a little bad, a giant one is very very bad.

mileskimball	695626570367631360	2016-02-05T15:14:33	Federalist_10 On the theoretical side, models where minimum wages improve things always say they'll do so only up to a point.
mileskimball	695626326401802240	2016-02-05T15:13:34	Federalist_10 On long-run effects, I turn again to the high unemployment rates in Puerto Rico.

mileskimball	695625848188243969	2016-02-05T15:11:40	Federalist_10 But a small positive short-run effect on employment compared to a large negative long-run effect still would be quite bad.
mileskimball	695625643443286020	2016-02-05T15:10:52	Federalist_10 Of studies showing small short-run effects on employment, the ones showing small positives are probably wrong.
mileskimball	695625444117368832	2016-02-05T15:10:04	Federalist_10 Many studies show that the short-run effects on employment are small. The issue is the long-run effects.
