IanKingSky	705880228586004480	2016-03-04T22:18:55	pensionschamp AnneAshworth beckymbarrow that's my point, Alan. 45p taxpayers get 15% of all 'relief' but pay c.27% of all income tax.
IanKingSky	705878566840483846	2016-03-04T22:12:19	AnneAshworth beckymbarrow He hasn't backed down fully. Crude  assault on 45p taxpayers, creating marginal rate of 67%, still going ahead.
