Hubon	707539189714305024	2016-03-09T12:11:02	Jaguarsoenardi when momentum is topping out and diverging, and you have a NR7 it usually gets spectacular fake signals, thats all I know

Hubon	707478764649897984	2016-03-09T08:10:56	UdallTechStrat its worthless
Hubon	707478684198895616	2016-03-09T08:10:37	UdallTechStrat THIS is the global situation, and in commodity space its totally out of control
Hubon	707477419884683264	2016-03-09T08:05:35	UdallTechStrat that story works not only for this worthless peace of crap they ramp up 40 % and its the inflation basket
Hubon	707477182457716736	2016-03-09T08:04:39	@UdallTechStratthink about what you trade, when you enter inflation basket rally, thats what I see across da board  
Hubon	707476682752573441	2016-03-09T08:02:40	ok last one, maybe I forgot to paint a TL on DAX 
Hubon	707476140634599425	2016-03-09T08:00:30	UdallTechStrat debt has 10 folded since 1999 and the underlying is lower than 1999, thats all I have to say 
Hubon	707475961558781952	2016-03-09T07:59:48	UdallTechStrat why should I pay more for this basket, when debt since 1990 ridiculously exploded and the underlying is lower than ever?
Hubon	707474895190495232	2016-03-09T07:55:33	I wish you a great day
Hubon	707474833781727232	2016-03-09T07:55:19	The huge debt pile, a totally destroyed planet, sick people, and tons of debt, please inflation basket grow from here I beg you
Hubon	707474683302715392	2016-03-09T07:54:43	ZIRP and reckless Governments have allowed to grow companies bigger and bigger as this is the only way to grow, and now we have monsters
Hubon	707474509591347200	2016-03-09T07:54:01	The business model of the Inflation Basket is simple: It can not invent new products as the periodic table is finite.
Hubon	707474292041236481	2016-03-09T07:53:10	UdallTechStrat 
Hubon	707474036058624000	2016-03-09T07:52:09	UdallTechStrat usually you get a higher low, aka. pullback building a bottom, then you need positive momentum
Hubon	707473870857621508	2016-03-09T07:51:29	UdallTechStrat if you think this is a bottom ok, the glass is always half full or half empty
Hubon	707472595625623552	2016-03-09T07:46:25	WTIC bulls still can argue that it wants to start a trend move, lets give it the benefit of the doubt 
Hubon	707471336738783232	2016-03-09T07:41:25	last but not least, the party in inflation basket started with the triple top breakout in CRB

Hubon	707468661297127424	2016-03-09T07:30:47	On a weekly basis, the inflation and deflation basket now are highly correlated, condition needed for market tops 
Hubon	707468304340881408	2016-03-09T07:29:22	The star of last week is the inflation basket, where debt is unsustainable, funny how Brazil &amp; Russia follow best

Hubon	707464009801404416	2016-03-09T07:12:18	During the past week, professional traders have been heavily shorting into Gold, certainly not a bullish message

Hubon	698443028718026752	2016-02-13T09:46:09	griffinmcgee the US army stopped the Nazi not democracy, there was war. unfortunately the US hired about 3000 of them, thats another issue
