JoshuaGreen	693582743955898368	2016-01-30T23:53:06	In 2008, 60% of Dems in Selzer poll were 1st-time caucusgoers -- huge turnout. In 2016, 40% of Republicans in poll are 1st-time caucusgoers.

JoshuaGreen	688752085924458497	2016-01-17T15:57:48	Lotta @ feed confusion on this point: Cruz's NewYorkValues charge is **not about New York voters** -- he's speaking to a different audience
JoshuaGreen	688751089655656448	2016-01-17T15:53:50	Weirdest poll crosstab: a statistically insignificant, yet still non-zero number of Cruz supporters describe themselves as "Socialist"
JoshuaGreen	688748883904741380	2016-01-17T15:45:04	6. In conclusion: Cruz is playing the NY media like a Stradivarius on NewYorkValues.
JoshuaGreen	688748736424624128	2016-01-17T15:44:29	5. So sputtering outrage like NYDailyNews cover is so helpful to Cruz, should probably count as an in-kind donation 
JoshuaGreen	688748635597729792	2016-01-17T15:44:05	4. Because if there’s an antithesis of NewYorkValues it’s ”Christian values in opposing abortion/gay marriage" 
JoshuaGreen	688748505758851072	2016-01-17T15:43:34	3. So when Cruz “apologizes” for NewYorkValues, he’s really driving a wedge between Trump + his conservative fans: 
JoshuaGreen	688748382161113088	2016-01-17T15:43:05	2. Crosstabs also show a robust 82% of Trump supporters say they’re “values voters" — presumably not NewYorkValues 
JoshuaGreen	688748276942770177	2016-01-17T15:42:40	1. Bloomberg/DMR crosstabs: 79% of TRUMP supporters in Iowa say Cruz’s "Christian values in opposing abortion/gay marriage" are "attractive"
JoshuaGreen	688748059845627905	2016-01-17T15:41:48	Spent my pre-football hours yesterday digging into the crosstabs, which reveal exactly what Cruz is up to. I’ll tweet some highlights.
