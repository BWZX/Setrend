derekwillis	724955753887502336	2016-04-26T13:38:15	macloo markstencel kperry9 but what you don't know isn't literally magic.
derekwillis	724955690700279808	2016-04-26T13:38:00	macloo markstencel kperry9 absolutely. i don't suggest that all can be fixed. but we shouldn't be making it harder than it is.
derekwillis	724954471810342912	2016-04-26T13:33:09	macloo markstencel kperry9 i worry less about kids with access to elite programs &amp; internships. i worry a lot about the rest.
derekwillis	724954231103459328	2016-04-26T13:32:12	markstencel both are cause for skepticism.
derekwillis	724954108713656320	2016-04-26T13:31:43	macloo markstencel kperry9 but that's the point - i was neither a CS or eng student, and I was able to learn something. How many others?
derekwillis	724953945953689604	2016-04-26T13:31:04	macloo markstencel kperry9 I do know that. My q: how does it help to make these skills seem even LESS attainable?
derekwillis	724952999576145920	2016-04-26T13:27:18	markstencel if a baseball reporter asks a GM what the team needs &amp; response is "magician," that might be a sign of other issues.
derekwillis	724952642858934272	2016-04-26T13:25:53	markstencel or inconsistent.
derekwillis	724952596780310528	2016-04-26T13:25:42	markstencel and it's important to point out when those priorities are confusing or needlessly intimidating.
derekwillis	724952387216134145	2016-04-26T13:24:52	markstencel sure, but if they are really important, then they should not be optional.
derekwillis	724949933778935809	2016-04-26T13:15:07	macloo one way to dispel such fantasies is to be clear about skills &amp; opportunities. Hence my distaste for hyperbole like superpowers.
derekwillis	724948821004943360	2016-04-26T13:10:42	macloo a related problem, yes.
derekwillis	724948745566191616	2016-04-26T13:10:24	markstencel editors may say they want super powers, but they send mixed messages by making them seem both exceptional &amp; optional.
derekwillis	724948472949051392	2016-04-26T13:09:19	markstencel those aren't qualifications, though. They are "plus," add-ons.
derekwillis	724937827654504453	2016-04-26T12:27:01	markstencel and most editors understand and can evaluate these super powers?
derekwillis	724931317138382850	2016-04-26T12:01:09	derekwillis markstencel I saw this happen in a year of mentoring young journonerds. Capable people must often be convinced they're capable
derekwillis	724930576298479616	2016-04-26T11:58:12	roseveleth IT'S THE SAME GROUP OF GUYS.
derekwillis	724930429241974784	2016-04-26T11:57:37	roseveleth heroic.
derekwillis	724930226619322369	2016-04-26T11:56:49	roseveleth finally, someone gives these forgotten people a chance to be heard.
derekwillis	724928928150917120	2016-04-26T11:51:39	amzam feeling of learning new stuff is pretty special. but the intimidation factor is also too high. we need to bring it down.
derekwillis	724927549646721024	2016-04-26T11:46:10	markstencel imagine telling a journalism student looking to get into the business that "you'd be better off with superpowers."
derekwillis	724926862531674114	2016-04-26T11:43:27	markstencel and that's just it: it doesn't help people focus. It makes it seem less attainable.
derekwillis	724926754561871872	2016-04-26T11:43:01	markstencel calling them superpowers is elevating them way past their actual status. what writing jobs require superpowers? editing jobs?
derekwillis	724924481349816320	2016-04-26T11:33:59	whitecoatcapxg this is true.
derekwillis	724810603697717248	2016-04-26T04:01:28	markstencel as a writing technique, it's definitely a vivid metaphor. but it is a terrible message to send.
derekwillis	724810174054162435	2016-04-26T03:59:46	markstencel my argument is they could be less rare if we treated them as skills the way we treat other journalism skills. but we don't.
derekwillis	724809616715059200	2016-04-26T03:57:33	dhmontgomery actually, the magnets totally work.
derekwillis	724809515921760260	2016-04-26T03:57:09	It's doubly worse that we use the tool we are supposed to know best - the written word! - to spread this myth among our industry.
derekwillis	724809209318105088	2016-04-26T03:55:56	It infuriates me that we continue to assign magical properties to things - complex tho they may be - that are not beyond learning.
derekwillis	724808867763331076	2016-04-26T03:54:35	amzam markstencel kperry9 agreed - the table is useful, but the top doesn't reflect that sensibility.
derekwillis	724808059810369536	2016-04-26T03:51:22	This sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy. There are extraordinary people. Skills can be learned. 
derekwillis	724807655705948160	2016-04-26T03:49:46	markstencel kperry9 regardless, those people are not superheroes or wizards &amp; you don't encourage more that way.
derekwillis	724807432573165568	2016-04-26T03:48:52	markstencel kperry9 maybe they are not easy to find because they are treated as extraordinary, not of journalism?
derekwillis	724807318853005312	2016-04-26T03:48:25	markstencel kperry9 but these skills are *for* journalism, yes?
derekwillis	724807104704450561	2016-04-26T03:47:34	markstencel kperry9 perhaps that's because journalism &amp; j education has defined the skills that way?
derekwillis	724806885581422592	2016-04-26T03:46:42	markstencel kperry9 sure, at newer orgs, in theory everyone could be special (for awhile). but what about the others?
derekwillis	724806489043513344	2016-04-26T03:45:07	markstencel kperry9 elevating these skills to the extraordinary mainly discourages those "left behind" with ordinary duties.
derekwillis	724806025182896129	2016-04-26T03:43:17	markstencel kperry9 is that what you want? a newsroom divided into superheroes and normals? i don't want that.
derekwillis	724805930924265472	2016-04-26T03:42:54	markstencel kperry9 the more you use language that suggests that these are not journalism roles, the more intimidating they are.
derekwillis	724805554275794947	2016-04-26T03:41:25	markstencel kperry9 no. call them what they are: journalists. what about the skills you describe make them "special" compared to others?
derekwillis	724801421128900609	2016-04-26T03:24:59	markstencel kperry9 well, they are kinda hard to get to, to be honest. the intro didn't make me want to read more.
derekwillis	724790362661736450	2016-04-26T02:41:03	macloo derekwillis but I mean, that's true of anything. Magic is the opposite: implies no practice, just inherent gifts.
derekwillis	724790450754826240	2016-04-26T02:41:24	macloo right. the main impediment to learning digital skills that i see is the perceived gap.
derekwillis	724789374370631680	2016-04-26T02:37:07	macloo are they magic majors? because i've never had that problem.
derekwillis	724789119239507968	2016-04-26T02:36:06	Lastly, the idea of superpowers suggests that those who teach are light years ahead of students.  The truth: we're stumbling around, too.
derekwillis	724788388306509825	2016-04-26T02:33:12	People in journalism may want to call these skills superpowers, but authors of Tow-Knight report should know better &amp; not played into it.

derekwillis	724787621969453056	2016-04-26T02:30:09	VCamron_writer harrisj yes, that's exactly why.
derekwillis	724787199846305792	2016-04-26T02:28:28	derekwillis very true! And satisfying when it works; magic would feel like a cop out anyways.
derekwillis	724787093076070400	2016-04-26T02:28:03	xaranke which is *another* reason why journalism shouldn't be encouraging the term - we can't pay superpower salaries!
derekwillis	724786946250301440	2016-04-26T02:27:28	RuthServen you can do it. if i can, anyone can. but it's work, not magic.
derekwillis	724786771398148096	2016-04-26T02:26:46	"Wizardry," also bad descriptor, at least carries idea that there are schools for this (thanks, JK Rowling!). Superpowers is clickbait term.

derekwillis	724784712837902336	2016-04-26T02:18:36	These are not "superpowers," and calling them that is not the way to get journalists &amp; students to think they can learn them.

derekwillis	722785082503786496	2016-04-20T13:52:47	zz2aa you too!
derekwillis	722783999614169092	2016-04-20T13:48:28	zz2aa def agree.
derekwillis	722782503472406529	2016-04-20T13:42:32	zz2aa i guess we'll find out.
derekwillis	722782214736449536	2016-04-20T13:41:23	zz2aa Sanders is in the best position to do it.
derekwillis	722781610173710337	2016-04-20T13:38:59	zz2aa it wouldn't hurt, but turnout is still pretty low even in general elections, where deadlines aren't as early.
derekwillis	722781138834604032	2016-04-20T13:37:06	zz2aa oh, i didn't say it would be easy. but it is the best way to do it. takes organization, effort, and turnout.
derekwillis	722780964724875264	2016-04-20T13:36:25	zz2aa agreed. i think voting is important enough that it's worth trying to fight through that when it happens.
derekwillis	722780117324460032	2016-04-20T13:33:03	zz2aa that's pretty much up to voters.
derekwillis	722779422718304256	2016-04-20T13:30:17	zz2aa goldietaylor in what sense?
derekwillis	722779357404655616	2016-04-20T13:30:02	zz2aa goldietaylor i get how that's a very real concern. i had to change my registration to vote in party primary this year.
derekwillis	722778994823847936	2016-04-20T13:28:35	joby_jacob inklake lizcgoodwin that's a different question, and up to state lawmakers. arguably election administration could be worse.
derekwillis	722778517793017857	2016-04-20T13:26:41	zz2aa goldietaylor because that's not what a party primary is. that's a general election.
derekwillis	722776465859809282	2016-04-20T13:18:32	Not sure how I missed this, but BBC has a "College of Journalism" blog:

derekwillis	722768843244969984	2016-04-20T12:48:15	JayAckroyd KagroX sure, and there are a number of reasons for that.
derekwillis	722768075892924416	2016-04-20T12:45:12	JayAckroyd KagroX I'm pretty sure you can, at least in some circumstances. Politics doesn't work well as a spectator activity.
derekwillis	722767703866490880	2016-04-20T12:43:43	Casual_Obs KagroX yes, it votes for state officials who set policies for voter registration, for example.
derekwillis	722766808558780416	2016-04-20T12:40:10	JayAckroyd KagroX that said, primary turnout has never approached general turnout.
derekwillis	722766733883412480	2016-04-20T12:39:52	JayAckroyd KagroX I could see it being an issue for both parties, but yeah.
derekwillis	722765287091793920	2016-04-20T12:34:07	Oh wow that turned dark quickly

derekwillis	722765297132900354	2016-04-20T12:34:09	JayAckroyd KagroX you may be right, altho we've had more fractures electorates, too.

derekwillis	722753864072634368	2016-04-20T11:48:43	PattReid goldietaylor by end of Oct 2015 he was at 30% in national polling:

derekwillis	722752504388259845	2016-04-20T11:43:19	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin No argument there. party primaries are different from general elections.

derekwillis	722750806861213696	2016-04-20T11:36:35	joby_jacob inklake lizcgoodwin agreed.
derekwillis	722750465260318720	2016-04-20T11:35:13	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin or Clinton's, for that matter?
derekwillis	722750385434279940	2016-04-20T11:34:54	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin have Bernie's policies changed in past 6 months, or has his chances of winning?
derekwillis	722750199832145920	2016-04-20T11:34:10	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin I agree 6 months is long. In MD/PA it's about a month. Is any deadline acceptable?
derekwillis	722749755651174404	2016-04-20T11:32:24	Angry_Husky I'm confused. So voting in primaries doesn't matter?
derekwillis	722749590513000448	2016-04-20T11:31:45	joby_jacob inklake lizcgoodwin exactly
derekwillis	722748998784847872	2016-04-20T11:29:23	joby_jacob inklake lizcgoodwin and govt did have a say - they set the voter registration deadline, right?
derekwillis	722748638758313984	2016-04-20T11:27:58	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin do voters have any responsibility in this?
derekwillis	722748313825644544	2016-04-20T11:26:40	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin not at all. Caucuses have weird and arcane rules &amp; often place a much higher burden on participants.
derekwillis	722747233913933824	2016-04-20T11:22:23	joby_jacob inklake lizcgoodwin and under state rules, which means voters have a role in this process.
derekwillis	722746528943771648	2016-04-20T11:19:35	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin all of which was known to Sanders campaign, right?
derekwillis	722746221723525120	2016-04-20T11:18:21	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin seems weird to celebrate caucus wins and loudly complain about NY's rules.

derekwillis	722743945218887680	2016-04-20T11:09:19	DCSoljaGurl poor election administration is a bad thing, agreed. that's not a result of having a closed primary.
derekwillis	722743783734013952	2016-04-20T11:08:40	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin what about caucuses, which can have even smaller participation? Are they ok?
derekwillis	722743668403265536	2016-04-20T11:08:13	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin ok, but elections require participation, no?
derekwillis	722742741382389760	2016-04-20T11:04:32	PattReid goldietaylor Bernie was a declared candidate before October, right?
derekwillis	722742368282230784	2016-04-20T11:03:03	Angry_Husky in a much different sense, actually.
derekwillis	722742299860537344	2016-04-20T11:02:46	DCSoljaGurl I have many problems with ppl not being able to vote. If a candidate seeks party nomination, does so under party's rules.
derekwillis	722741369576550400	2016-04-20T10:59:05	ricfouad goldietaylor lizcgoodwin where did I say that? I think ppl can vote to change party leaders, tho.

derekwillis	722578519256088576	2016-04-20T00:11:58	YeaYouRite this isn't hilarious. i just think there is some responsibility on the part of the voter, that's all.
derekwillis	722577969328365568	2016-04-20T00:09:47	YeaYouRite out of curiosity: who made the deadline October?
derekwillis	722577759940276224	2016-04-20T00:08:57	YeaYouRite surprised you kept at this long, given that it was such a burden.
derekwillis	722577610732093440	2016-04-20T00:08:21	YeaYouRite that's the argument for changing any policy you don't like.
derekwillis	722577495543963648	2016-04-20T00:07:54	YeaYouRite I agree; the deadline is arbitrary and strikes me as too early. but it wasn't a surprise or unknowable.
derekwillis	722577174939705344	2016-04-20T00:06:37	YeaYouRite i have said nothing about voter id.
derekwillis	722577062305861632	2016-04-20T00:06:11	YeaYouRite exactly. but it can be an important box, so you might want to check up on things from time to time.
derekwillis	722576871007916032	2016-04-20T00:05:25	YeaYouRite how is clicking a link easy?
derekwillis	722576814170836992	2016-04-20T00:05:11	YeaYouRite if you want to register as a party member, you have a responsibility. a burden, if you will.
derekwillis	722576479989719041	2016-04-20T00:03:52	YeaYouRite you don't have to call, that's the point.
derekwillis	722576188384874496	2016-04-20T00:02:42	YeaYouRite I mean, NY state has an app to check this.     There's an 800 number.  It takes a phone call or a click.
derekwillis	722575974492213248	2016-04-20T00:01:51	jrmithdobbs YeaYouRite RT_com fine: it's the only way that every single citizen can do it without risking life or property.
derekwillis	722575808703950848	2016-04-20T00:01:12	YeaYouRite of course not, but again, if that's the law, then you need to vote to change that.
derekwillis	722575321027985408	2016-04-19T23:59:15	YeaYouRite if you want that to change, the best way is to vote for people who will do it. to do that, you should check your registration.
derekwillis	722575022301278208	2016-04-19T23:58:04	YeaYouRite should states leave dead people on the rolls? people who have moved and registered elsewhere?
derekwillis	722574904797884418	2016-04-19T23:57:36	YeaYouRite many states have laws that *require* purging voter rolls. again, you have the right to vote, but you have responsibilities, too.
derekwillis	722574524210880513	2016-04-19T23:56:06	Checking your voter registration is the *only* way to fix this. 
derekwillis	722574249324634112	2016-04-19T23:55:00	YeaYouRite well, that's how you find out if gov made an error, for one. in fact, it's the only way.
derekwillis	722573760700747776	2016-04-19T23:53:03	YeaYouRite but those ways involve getting involved. showing up to vote without checking your registration is, i think, a bad choice.
derekwillis	722573607545737216	2016-04-19T23:52:27	YeaYouRite No, but again, voting is both a right and a responsibility. And there are ways to change that deadline.
derekwillis	722573171803701248	2016-04-19T23:50:43	YeaYouRite there are more than two in NY.
derekwillis	722572891947155456	2016-04-19T23:49:36	You know who decides how primaries are conducted? Members of parties.

derekwillis	722555609564987392	2016-04-19T22:40:56	palewire in many cases lately, it's not a consensus idea; it's one party driving it (or other changes).
derekwillis	722554905563688960	2016-04-19T22:38:08	palewire probably lawmakers/state officials who decided to make it happen. they have authority to do this. MD has 8 days of early voting.
derekwillis	722554445528186880	2016-04-19T22:36:18	palewire poll taxes, machine politics, you name it. but also civic indifference.
derekwillis	722554305811726338	2016-04-19T22:35:45	Also true, but subject to campaign effects. 
derekwillis	722553906438541313	2016-04-19T22:34:10	palewire yes, and there are a fair number of orgs out there that do that. There's some responsibility on the voter, too.

derekwillis	722553578712342528	2016-04-19T22:32:52	Voting issues in NYC today are reminder that voting is responsibility of gov AND citizen. Ppl should check their voter registration status.
derekwillis	722553265708208128	2016-04-19T22:31:37	Also a possibility. 
derekwillis	722553017057329154	2016-04-19T22:30:38	Some possibilities:  1. HRC is turning voters against Sanders 2. They have overlapping but not identical electorates 
derekwillis	722552313710297088	2016-04-19T22:27:50	Complaints about voting mechanics by Sanders supporters suggest they've not exactly been banging down the door in crucial midterm elections.

derekwillis	721311927910199296	2016-04-16T12:18:59	Atunci_CoV it does no such thing.

derekwillis	716404736346427393	2016-04-02T23:19:33	arrjet17 lemme ask this way: compared to other candidates you supported in past, what will Trump do differently?
derekwillis	716403705952776192	2016-04-02T23:15:28	arrjet17 why?
derekwillis	716403495067365376	2016-04-02T23:14:38	arrjet17 sure, but lots of ppl work hard.

derekwillis	715299864377233409	2016-03-30T22:09:11	jbarro probably has been tried.
derekwillis	715299667140067328	2016-03-30T22:08:24	Cronikeys nalathekoala and for a self-described election journalist, you seem kinda poorly informed, tbh.
derekwillis	715299550735560704	2016-03-30T22:07:57	Cronikeys nalathekoala that has nothing to do with campaign finance reform.
derekwillis	715299460792733696	2016-03-30T22:07:35	jbarro think of the tax implications.
derekwillis	715299340441559040	2016-03-30T22:07:07	Cronikeys nalathekoala and you did criticize donations by special interests, no?
derekwillis	715299223894368256	2016-03-30T22:06:39	Cronikeys nalathekoala 1 of every 4 dollars his campaign has is from ppl not named Donald Trump.
derekwillis	715299118843879425	2016-03-30T22:06:14	Cronikeys nalathekoala is he?
derekwillis	715298617385480192	2016-03-30T22:04:14	Cronikeys nalathekoala sort of - it &amp; other cases gave PACs ability to raise unlimited contribs to spend independent of candidates.
derekwillis	715298305589252096	2016-03-30T22:03:00	Cronikeys nalathekoala did you just criticize 1st amendment protected election spending &amp; praise wisdom of 1st amdt? Neat trick.
derekwillis	715293505640333313	2016-03-30T21:43:55	Trump may have just set a land-speed record for course correction amid controversy 
derekwillis	715295513260728320	2016-03-30T21:51:54	Cronikeys nalathekoala also thanks to first amendment (and federal courts)
derekwillis	715292287228633088	2016-03-30T21:39:05	Cronikeys nalathekoala exactly. for many folks, policy decisions are important.
derekwillis	715292102427586566	2016-03-30T21:38:21	sane_american Cronikeys nalathekoala so I've heard
derekwillis	715291941274066944	2016-03-30T21:37:42	Cronikeys nalathekoala wait, you said that abortion is important enough to be returned to states, since 10th amdt is so important.
derekwillis	715291677913653248	2016-03-30T21:36:40	Cronikeys nalathekoala So no special interests at all have given him money?
derekwillis	715291479976054785	2016-03-30T21:35:52	sane_american Cronikeys nalathekoala weird how lobbyists are still technically people.
derekwillis	715291218247360512	2016-03-30T21:34:50	Cronikeys nalathekoala so on issues he doesn't care about, he is free to lie?
derekwillis	715291056393338881	2016-03-30T21:34:11	Cronikeys nalathekoala as do other candidates.
derekwillis	715290949967081473	2016-03-30T21:33:46	Cronikeys nalathekoala and nearly 50% is not 50%.
derekwillis	715290862285139968	2016-03-30T21:33:25	Cronikeys nalathekoala the will of the ppl supports abortion being legal.
derekwillis	715290733104795649	2016-03-30T21:32:54	Cronikeys nalathekoala so is he in favor of abortion being legal or not?
derekwillis	715290596764725248	2016-03-30T21:32:22	Cronikeys nalathekoala still means he's not self-funding.
derekwillis	715290413242925057	2016-03-30T21:31:38	Cronikeys nalathekoala but if you're correct, how do you explain his abortion position given that majority supports it legal?
derekwillis	715290243717586944	2016-03-30T21:30:58	Cronikeys nalathekoala so you don't think reps should have positions that they adhere to and make case for?
derekwillis	715290057100423168	2016-03-30T21:30:13	Cronikeys nalathekoala so I should not believe anything he says?
derekwillis	715289937340461056	2016-03-30T21:29:45	Cronikeys nalathekoala and he is partially self-funding; has raised 9.5 million from others.
derekwillis	715289808898232320	2016-03-30T21:29:14	Cronikeys nalathekoala the point of representative gov is to say whatever ppl want to hear? maybe you can join me in gov101.
derekwillis	715289596393865216	2016-03-30T21:28:23	Cronikeys nalathekoala define "most"
derekwillis	715289516395900933	2016-03-30T21:28:04	Cronikeys nalathekoala ppl can &amp; do change minds on issues. If he has on abortion, he needs to own it. If not, he's lying.
derekwillis	715289283922407424	2016-03-30T21:27:09	Cronikeys nalathekoala but earlier interviews - wouldn't they suggest that he will say whatever he thinks ppl want to hear?
derekwillis	715289038954098688	2016-03-30T21:26:10	Cronikeys nalathekoala I know lots of ppl who are populists and love USA. Those aren't only reasons to be elected president.
derekwillis	715288718517657604	2016-03-30T21:24:54	Cronikeys nalathekoala it's not in the constitution. But Supreme Court is, and it has decided that an abortion ban isn't constitutional.
derekwillis	715288375012560896	2016-03-30T21:23:32	Cronikeys nalathekoala so it's ok to lie to voters about his position on abortion, but doing so doesn't make him a politician? OK.
derekwillis	715288040772648960	2016-03-30T21:22:12	Cronikeys nalathekoala I mean, a Trump administration cannot unilaterally declare that legality of abortion is now an issue for states.
derekwillis	715287842721759233	2016-03-30T21:21:25	Cronikeys nalathekoala ok, but it IS. you kinda have to work with the situation you have, right?
derekwillis	715287463460257793	2016-03-30T21:19:55	Cronikeys nalathekoala I mean, either he favors banning abortion or he just lied about favoring it.
derekwillis	715287209344180224	2016-03-30T21:18:54	Cronikeys nalathekoala not sure how states rights figure into whether abortion is legal or not.
derekwillis	715286999771561985	2016-03-30T21:18:04	Cronikeys nalathekoala which claims am I discrediting? should I not take him at his word?
derekwillis	715285851870261248	2016-03-30T21:13:31	Cronikeys nalathekoala and it is a federal issue. Only way it could be returned to states is via Supreme Court.
derekwillis	715285653651591168	2016-03-30T21:12:43	Cronikeys nalathekoala he favors making it illegal. He said so.
derekwillis	715280437770395649	2016-03-30T20:52:00	AlbertReichmann jaketapper sure it is. stories I've seen say he favors both a ban &amp; punishment under a ban.
derekwillis	715260005205864448	2016-03-30T19:30:48	obviously Trump was saying the punishment for the woman should come if abortion were made illegal. Which he says he favors.
derekwillis	715278813085696001	2016-03-30T20:45:32	Cronikeys article also says his position is to ban it, so he was arguing for a ban and punishment, no?
derekwillis	715269869785235456	2016-03-30T20:10:00	Trump tried to dodge the question, putting it back on Matthews/church position. Eventually he answered.

derekwillis	714258868130463744	2016-03-28T01:12:39	Anuhint1 but even if it does, does it matter more than, say, actual policies?

derekwillis	711638522030120960	2016-03-20T19:40:19	Pignou_ rcallimachi oh, that's not true: plenty of journalists know little of economics.

derekwillis	711637137372934145	2016-03-20T19:34:49	Pignou_ rcallimachi maybe so. i'm not always good about what is and isn't interesting to general public, so i tend to err on interesting.
derekwillis	711636783457505281	2016-03-20T19:33:25	Pignou_ rcallimachi yes, absolutely - don't think press knows more than intel agencies in this regard - but readers may not.

derekwillis	710605357387816960	2016-03-17T23:14:54	trianglesides right: "You should note that this rule does not apply to non-profit organizations."  NPR is a non-profit organization.
derekwillis	710604589209415685	2016-03-17T23:11:51	trianglesides that's what I don't get: if you tell an NPR listener to download an NPR-produced podcast, how is that a violation?
derekwillis	710604170873716738	2016-03-17T23:10:11	trianglesides I'm looking at this:  &amp; see calls to action can't be in underwriting, but none anywhere?
derekwillis	710602704071036930	2016-03-17T23:04:21	trianglesides but even if that's the case, not promoting NPR One surely isn't included in that.
derekwillis	710602536844193793	2016-03-17T23:03:41	trianglesides so this isn't the full memo? 
derekwillis	710601280125849601	2016-03-17T22:58:42	trianglesides i mean, they are NPR &amp; have had podcasts for awhile now, and are *just* remembering the FCC rules? I don't believe that.
derekwillis	710601158985957376	2016-03-17T22:58:13	trianglesides if that were the case, why wouldn't they have known that? the call to action is to subscribe to the podcast, not to buy it.
derekwillis	710599317678125057	2016-03-17T22:50:54	trianglesides KVRX if it were, wouldn't the memo say that?
derekwillis	710597768516136960	2016-03-17T22:44:44	A risk, of course, for NPR &amp; member stations is that someone comes along &amp; hires away its great podcast hosts.

derekwillis	708707224017743872	2016-03-12T17:32:24	On data journalism education, I want to believe that schools are doing the right thing. But I keep coming back to what my pastor says: 1/2

derekwillis	708698925755072513	2016-03-12T16:59:25	danfagin Penenberg sure, but that doesn't remove relevance for data journalism. lots of job postings here at nicar16.

derekwillis	708682078838067200	2016-03-12T15:52:28	derekwillis Seems like the view is often "This is really important and current, but we just don't have time for it now."
derekwillis	708680056856510464	2016-03-12T15:44:26	AustinClemens2 as far as I am aware, yes, but i may be making a blanket statement. may not apply to all crickets.
derekwillis	708679943878737920	2016-03-12T15:43:59	jeffjarvis cunyjschool miguelpaz was glad to see it. how is "distinguished lecturer" different from, say, a professor position?
derekwillis	708679495453114368	2016-03-12T15:42:13	Penenberg no, that's ridiculous. i'm saying that, broadly speaking, journalism schools don't make this a priority, which is accurate.
derekwillis	708679286278979584	2016-03-12T15:41:23	Penenberg not based in NY, no. I get it: NYU is an excellent school. that's not my point. I'm talking broadly here.
derekwillis	708679094528036864	2016-03-12T15:40:37	Penenberg there are several folks who were hired to teach data journalism as "professors of practice," making them 2nd-tier to colleagues.
derekwillis	708678069695881216	2016-03-12T15:36:33	Penenberg merbroussard would argue that issue of tenure in positions that teach data journalism is part of problem.
derekwillis	708677835020341248	2016-03-12T15:35:37	Penenberg and the others? I care a lot more about journalism education broadly than I do about any one school.
derekwillis	708677220089331716	2016-03-12T15:33:10	Penenberg and we can't all go to Columbia, sadly. i sure wouldn't have been able to.
derekwillis	708677117765095426	2016-03-12T15:32:46	Penenberg if only 18 accredited schools offer 3 or more classes about data, listing the others would take awhile on twitter.
derekwillis	708676731436199937	2016-03-12T15:31:14	Penenberg i love merbroussard &amp; glad she's there, but it seems like maybe this could have happened earlier?
derekwillis	708676535230832640	2016-03-12T15:30:27	Penenberg that's precisely what this report did.
derekwillis	708675263245082624	2016-03-12T15:25:23	Penenberg the problem is that there are "traditional" &amp; non-traditional courses.
derekwillis	708675094969585664	2016-03-12T15:24:43	Penenberg some is clearly not enough, and not even half of accredited schools, according to the report. It is broadly true, if annoying.
derekwillis	708674679678980097	2016-03-12T15:23:04	Penenberg with respect, that's not data journalism. It's useful &amp; necessary, but not the same at all.
derekwillis	708671915976556544	2016-03-12T15:12:05	darinblass good luck. find what you love.
derekwillis	708670992986595328	2016-03-12T15:08:25	But on balance, my guess is many GOP voters, not just Trump supporters, see protesters as the ones who are initiating things…
derekwillis	708670477984731136	2016-03-12T15:06:23	antheaws could have spent more time on it.
derekwillis	708670359860543489	2016-03-12T15:05:54	darinblass both can be, but actual experience probably more beneficial. schools can provide the network to get internships, tho.
derekwillis	708670175529271296	2016-03-12T15:05:10	fouge heh, fair.
derekwillis	708670119476596736	2016-03-12T15:04:57	fouge lucastimmons yep, that will always be the case for some. should be less necessary is what i'm saying.
derekwillis	708669748708548608	2016-03-12T15:03:29	fouge sure, but journalism degrees are rarely about the financial value.
derekwillis	708669530105626625	2016-03-12T15:02:37	fouge pretty sure that a college that can't or won't teach data skills is already devaluing the practice aspects of doing journalism.
derekwillis	708669339336048640	2016-03-12T15:01:51	darinblass you'll also want to write a lot, to help find your voice and how you work. it's hard, b/c there's no perfect way for everyone.
derekwillis	708668710802878464	2016-03-12T14:59:21	fouge i imagine that will be a popular option for many. concern is that at some point journo college itself becomes less essential.
derekwillis	708668538882490369	2016-03-12T14:58:40	derekwillis I have been seeking a university comp. sci-focused option to pair with my excellent practical journo college diploma. hybrid
derekwillis	708668519962034176	2016-03-12T14:58:36	jess_aloe which is also weird given that it's a school based on asking questions. this is knowable; they could ask.
derekwillis	708668310838251521	2016-03-12T14:57:46	darinblass also, be comfortable asking strangers questions. waiting tables helped me with that!
derekwillis	708668162506661888	2016-03-12T14:57:11	darinblass read/watch/listen to a lot of journalism. figure out what kinds of stories you like &amp; then try to figure out how they were done.
derekwillis	708667666001694721	2016-03-12T14:55:12	jess_aloe which is weird, because these are knowable skills. either it's a priority or it's not.
derekwillis	708667490893754368	2016-03-12T14:54:30	derekwillis my j-school tried, but struggled to teach data skills. I learned all I know through IRE/Nicar, MOOCs, &amp; other online resources
derekwillis	708667334895017984	2016-03-12T14:53:53	macloo that baffles me more than anything, I think.
derekwillis	708667271783325696	2016-03-12T14:53:38	Schools can't have "considerable interest" in adding data journalism classes &amp; then depend entirely on adjuncts with little voice. NICAR16
derekwillis	708666748497752065	2016-03-12T14:51:33	If journalism schools value these skills, they can either find faculty to teach them or require that existing faculty do it.
derekwillis	708666335362940929	2016-03-12T14:49:55	macloo I think that's *a* stumbling block. I don't think it's *the* stumbling block. I think it's much more involved.
derekwillis	708666031162695684	2016-03-12T14:48:42	Real risk for journalism schools is students will consider them even less essential. These are skills that schools need to own. NICAR16
derekwillis	708665523765174273	2016-03-12T14:46:41	IRE is getting better at offering online trainings; MOOCs hold promise, too. If schools can't commit to this, others will. NICAR16
derekwillis	708665248748838912	2016-03-12T14:45:36	Very curious to read report on teaching data journalism:   Think schools have short time to get this right. NICAR16

derekwillis	707706476895334400	2016-03-09T23:15:47	dmm104 I don't condone this. Just wonder why you cite is as an example of govt waste?

derekwillis	707703988494405632	2016-03-09T23:05:54	dmm104 migrants turning down food over cross strikes me as short-sighted. Not sure what it has to do with federal spending.
derekwillis	707703714472173568	2016-03-09T23:04:48	dmm104 by the same token, corporate profits could also feed many. or the money spent on coffee. like I said, I don't believe it's either/or
derekwillis	707703259608305664	2016-03-09T23:03:00	dmm104 nope, I don't presume to be smarter than anyone. I just ask questions; that's my job. So I get annoying.

derekwillis	707558875197788160	2016-03-09T13:29:16	brittanystoroz persimmon. Hands down
derekwillis	707408581256224768	2016-03-09T03:32:03	dmm104 I asked you what federal programs gave food to illegal immigrants; you said Red Cross. That's not a federal program. Good night.
derekwillis	707407133067886592	2016-03-09T03:26:18	dmm104 the Red Cross is a private organization.
derekwillis	707406907787616257	2016-03-09T03:25:24	dmm104 ok, but probably not an imported beer. worried about tariffs.
derekwillis	707406609673273344	2016-03-09T03:24:13	dmm104 illegal immigrants "provided a surplus of $35.1 billion to the Medicare Trust Fund between 2000 and 2011"  
derekwillis	707406076262686720	2016-03-09T03:22:06	dmm104 so you'd like to see some form of privatization? Because last year Trump said he opposes that.
derekwillis	707405309229338624	2016-03-09T03:19:03	dmm104 you may not, but that will cause prices to rise &amp; trigger penalties under our trade agreements. So you ok with higher prices?
derekwillis	707404647758172160	2016-03-09T03:16:25	dmm104 but let's say you're right about all of that. The savings don't amount to much compared to Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid
derekwillis	707404215715504128	2016-03-09T03:14:42	dmm104 what federal programs give food to illegal immigrant adults?
derekwillis	707404002888130560	2016-03-09T03:13:51	dmm104 you know that illegal immigrants aren't eligible for federal welfare programs?
derekwillis	707403679821910016	2016-03-09T03:12:34	dmm104 it's not silly. he said Mexico pays. How?
derekwillis	707403598578188288	2016-03-09T03:12:15	dmm104 except Hillary is leading
derekwillis	707403496119730176	2016-03-09T03:11:51	dmm104 admittedly, constitutional system can be frustrating, but that's what we have. if exec &amp; legis branch can't agree, nothing happens.
derekwillis	707403245459808256	2016-03-09T03:10:51	dmm104 without president control of congress doesn't always translate into success. what could they have gotten done that Obama would sign?
derekwillis	707402879699701761	2016-03-09T03:09:24	dmm104 personally, I'd kinda like to know how he'd get some of this done. The wall, for example. Or trade.
derekwillis	707401828367990784	2016-03-09T03:05:13	dmm104 it's def a useful skill. but a lot of gov can't run like a business. some very diff rules, thanks to constitution.

derekwillis	707389267274817536	2016-03-09T02:15:18	dmm104 i see goals there, not actual plans.
derekwillis	707389052639715328	2016-03-09T02:14:27	dmm104 thanks for bearing with me.
derekwillis	707388817850941440	2016-03-09T02:13:31	dmm104 so what would a President Trump do?
derekwillis	707388593556299777	2016-03-09T02:12:38	dmm104 for example: 
derekwillis	707388210146635776	2016-03-09T02:11:06	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler which means that money isn't electoral destiny, which is my point.
derekwillis	707388075333296128	2016-03-09T02:10:34	dmm104 how much savings do you estimate we'll get from eliminating waste, fraud and abuse? got any evidence for that?
derekwillis	707387923461709825	2016-03-09T02:09:58	dmm104 waste, fraud and abuse is not a solution. i mean, it should be eliminated, but doing so will make little change in long-term outlook
derekwillis	707387683904102400	2016-03-09T02:09:01	dmm104 so who will? if Trump is GOP nominee, that usually means he'll support fellow Republicans on the ballot.
derekwillis	707387536335892480	2016-03-09T02:08:25	dmm104 so who will?
derekwillis	707386881135255552	2016-03-09T02:05:49	dmm104 so higher taxes? GOP congress will vote for that?
derekwillis	707386372366192640	2016-03-09T02:03:48	dmm104 congress has a 97% re-election rate. how are you going to change that?
derekwillis	707386083659653120	2016-03-09T02:02:39	dmm104 which of his policies would lead to job creation &amp; reduction in ppl on assistance?
derekwillis	707385888117006337	2016-03-09T02:01:52	dmm104 reduce what costs? for which services? how? he has pledged to increase the size of military budget - where does that come from?
derekwillis	707385709770964992	2016-03-09T02:01:10	dmm104 ok, but congress passes budgets &amp; spending bills. who decides what studies are "dumb"? most spending is mandatory, not discretionary
derekwillis	707385134450929664	2016-03-09T01:58:53	dmm104 you're talking goals - those sound good. but how would he accomplish them? what would he do differently? surely this matters.
derekwillis	707384177528856576	2016-03-09T01:55:05	dmm104 ok, so he'd do what instead?
derekwillis	707383818043441153	2016-03-09T01:53:39	dmm104  what? that's not what I asked. I asked specifically how he would do things differently as President.
derekwillis	707383440837099521	2016-03-09T01:52:09	dmm104 again, what does that mean in practice? how does he run things like a business?
derekwillis	707383142462656512	2016-03-09T01:50:58	derekwillis ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler but ok, how did that work out for Presidents Forbes and Perot?
derekwillis	707383068127006725	2016-03-09T01:50:40	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler wait, you said that $ gave you an advantage, though!

derekwillis	707382604354473984	2016-03-09T01:48:50	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans ok, what does that mean? how does that work?
derekwillis	707382375928479744	2016-03-09T01:47:55	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans Trump as ego-less guy not interested in power seems a stretch.
derekwillis	707382023707619329	2016-03-09T01:46:31	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans what new ways? genuinely curious.

derekwillis	707381274621640704	2016-03-09T01:43:33	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler how'd that work out for Jeb?
derekwillis	707381193415790592	2016-03-09T01:43:13	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans other businessmen have run for president. still didn't turn a profit. maybe i'm not grasping yours.
derekwillis	707380603713409030	2016-03-09T01:40:53	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans &amp; in either case, profit usually isn't result. For Trump, loaning $ means he can raise more to pay it back.
derekwillis	707380249437335554	2016-03-09T01:39:28	My face feels funny, like it's melting. 
derekwillis	707379961670279168	2016-03-09T01:38:20	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans well, i mean the process of running doesn't usually yield a profit. usually the opposite for large campaigns
derekwillis	707379260659539968	2016-03-09T01:35:32	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans getting elected isn't a business.
derekwillis	707378301929701376	2016-03-09T01:31:44	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans happened before that, too.
derekwillis	707377981635874816	2016-03-09T01:30:27	dmm104 davidfrum OCAmericans this happens at least every four years.
derekwillis	707377785023668225	2016-03-09T01:29:41	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 politicians use money they raise to pay for purely political trips. This is the law.
derekwillis	707377605855592448	2016-03-09T01:28:58	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 well, then, the GOP majority disagrees with you, and very much so.
derekwillis	707377453866553344	2016-03-09T01:28:22	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler sure, it can, but by that standard Obama, Clinton, Carter, Nixon, Ford would not have been elected.
derekwillis	707377096608366592	2016-03-09T01:26:56	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 there are rules for travel by elected officials.
derekwillis	707377011052945408	2016-03-09T01:26:36	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 I am pretty sure the ppl did not pay for his trip. Do you know differently?
derekwillis	707376818165256192	2016-03-09T01:25:50	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler again, money doesn't guarantee victory. Sanders seems to be doing ok.
derekwillis	707376682357886976	2016-03-09T01:25:18	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 because for individuals, that has been law for decades. Super PACs are newer. Both upheld by Supreme Court.
derekwillis	707376546420543490	2016-03-09T01:24:45	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 so you disagree with court decisions that people can spend as much of their own money as they want on elections?
derekwillis	707376307735240704	2016-03-09T01:23:48	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler but that doesn't translate into success, esp at presidential level.
derekwillis	707375851667636224	2016-03-09T01:22:00	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler hasn't always been the case for presidential races. See President Steve Forbes, for example.
derekwillis	707375665553735680	2016-03-09T01:21:15	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 they don't get free gov travel to purely political events.
derekwillis	707375569047048192	2016-03-09T01:20:52	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 they are candidates and they do travel on their campaign accounts as well as official gov business.
derekwillis	707375318861017089	2016-03-09T01:19:53	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler ok, but that totally undermines case for current Trump candidacy as well.
derekwillis	707375017416384514	2016-03-09T01:18:41	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler I just want to see where the line is, because this is a tough issue for the courts.
derekwillis	707374832246267904	2016-03-09T01:17:57	ChrisKyle02 dan_ehler so if I raise $50 million in small dollar donations, that's clean money, but 10 guys with $5 million each isn't?
derekwillis	707374609205698560	2016-03-09T01:17:03	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 candidates who fly on private jets have to pay for it like Trump does. Literally same rules.
derekwillis	707374357862076418	2016-03-09T01:16:03	This idea, that super PAC $ would have gone to feeding hungry, is just... wow.

derekwillis	707373214813569024	2016-03-09T01:11:31	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 sanders indeed has been very successful with small donors. Typically not as easy for GOP candidates.
derekwillis	707373017471524867	2016-03-09T01:10:44	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 current max to candidates is $2700 each for primary &amp; general. Super PACs have no limits, thanks to court decisions

derekwillis	707330559572353024	2016-03-08T22:22:01	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 I can appreciate that. What money is acceptable? Small donations? Self-financing?
derekwillis	707328294207754242	2016-03-08T22:13:01	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 you know every election has wasted money, right? politics isn't exactly an efficient business.
derekwillis	707315386916720640	2016-03-08T21:21:44	In terms of what has been disclosed to FEC so far, don't believe anyone has put more $ into a cmte this cycle than Donald Trump.
derekwillis	707313729411670016	2016-03-08T21:15:09	dan_ehler ChrisKyle02 my point is that this is not govt money &amp; it's not a zero-sum game. ppl can give to good causes &amp; bad politics.
derekwillis	707307432402395136	2016-03-08T20:50:07	882b53e0668c4b4 pretty sure wealthy ppl have always spent money on politics, sometimes for little or no return.

derekwillis	703306584181579777	2016-02-26T19:52:11	JPaulOsborne absolutely. journalism, good &amp; bad, is not without consequences, some of which aren't fully known when publishing.
derekwillis	703305248593592322	2016-02-26T19:46:52	So where did the rest of $1.5 million raised for Pataki super PAC go? CONSULTANTS:  
derekwillis	703304900055322625	2016-02-26T19:45:29	JPaulOsborne safeguards in editorial processes are a very good &amp; necessary thing. "safeguards" put into law are quite another.
derekwillis	703304674686996481	2016-02-26T19:44:35	JPaulOsborne been aware of it for awhile, but it's not one of my daily reads.
derekwillis	703302938626822144	2016-02-26T19:37:41	JPaulOsborne and i'm sure you can see how conflating the two could be a very risky thing.
derekwillis	703302725556109312	2016-02-26T19:36:51	JPaulOsborne sure. also: 
derekwillis	703302406696738816	2016-02-26T19:35:35	Pro-Pataki super PAC raised $1.5 million; spent 1% on independent expenditures:  | 
derekwillis	703301913224282112	2016-02-26T19:33:37	JPaulOsborne on that we agree. i would hope it would not be the government.
derekwillis	703301525372850177	2016-02-26T19:32:05	JPaulOsborne that's VERY different from changing libel laws to permit govt (among others) to bankrupt media they don't like.
derekwillis	703300834952658944	2016-02-26T19:29:20	JPaulOsborne also, don't google "Yellow Journalism Era"
derekwillis	703300730153771008	2016-02-26T19:28:55	JPaulOsborne are there stats that back this up? increase over time? by medium?
derekwillis	703300517632610304	2016-02-26T19:28:04	JPaulOsborne but if you'd like to live in a place that criminalizes mistakes &amp; guts 1st Amendment, well, that's up to you.
derekwillis	703300334295322624	2016-02-26T19:27:21	JPaulOsborne most news outlets do pretty well most of the time. i think you paint with a very broad brush here.
derekwillis	703299840290197504	2016-02-26T19:25:23	JPaulOsborne i would suggest that such activity, while bad, is not libel under the law, nor should it be.
