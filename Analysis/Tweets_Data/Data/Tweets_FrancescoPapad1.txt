FrancescoPapad1	707938011183505408	2016-03-10T14:35:49	Draghi does not exclude helicopter money, rather he defines it as an "interesting concept", which they have not studied as yet.
FrancescoPapad1	707934755904315392	2016-03-10T14:22:53	Do the statements of Draghi that rates cannot go further down reduce the effects of the package of measures? Watch the € exchange rate.
FrancescoPapad1	707934089849004032	2016-03-10T14:20:14	Draghi seems to accept that inflation may exceed 2% eventually for quite some time.

FrancescoPapad1	707926187457323009	2016-03-10T13:48:50	Inflation at 1.8% in  2018 in €-area is quite inconsistent with the "lower but close to % in the medium term" ECB objective.

FrancescoPapad1	672419643081039872	2015-12-03T14:18:30	Draghi anticipates that the ECB will be more vocal on fiscal policy, hinting to the fact that the ECB may not be happy with it.
FrancescoPapad1	672417927178637312	2015-12-03T14:11:41	The euro appreciation is a sign of disappointment with the measures taken by the ECB. Draghi this time under-delivered.

FrancescoPapad1	664411734338379776	2015-11-11T11:57:56	I think it is easy to exaggerate the effect of a lower ECB deposit rate on the € exchange rate and thus on regaining price stability.
