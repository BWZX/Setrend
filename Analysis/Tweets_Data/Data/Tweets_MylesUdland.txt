MylesUdland	714256637234647041	2016-03-28T01:03:47	NYCPunter if weeds was the top of the housing bubble, Girls is the bottom.
MylesUdland	714256040561352705	2016-03-28T01:01:24	NYCPunter I think the marginal suburban seller who bought home 25-30 years and owns outright will be less price sensitive than some think
MylesUdland	714254586341695492	2016-03-28T00:55:38	NYCPunter right. so I'm thinking more about housing cycle as replacement of old suburban families to new ones, not sort of post-war shift
MylesUdland	714253872106233856	2016-03-28T00:52:47	NYCPunter millennial, raised in burbs, living in NY, looking/listening/reading about how suburbs won't be a thing: they will.
MylesUdland	714253043408220163	2016-03-28T00:49:30	NYCPunter so assume risk-averse young family wants good school, services, etc. they, on balance, take suburbs &gt; recovering/trending city
MylesUdland	714252900743163905	2016-03-28T00:48:56	NYCPunter I guess the other side of this is: suburban developers/govs/planners have a MASSIVE edge on leading-edge urban buyers, broadly
MylesUdland	714252590637268992	2016-03-28T00:47:42	NYCPunter I think it will. But if millennial is largest cohort, will behavior, on balance, look like BK-Det-Portland or Atlanta in 90s?
MylesUdland	714251916377776128	2016-03-28T00:45:01	NYCPunter yeah, I think the BK-Queens thing might have legs to scale(ish), but outside NYC metro, suburbs &gt; city center

MylesUdland	714250567598665729	2016-03-28T00:39:40	NYCPunter ok, schools? parks? yard? rec leagues? I think insane taxes get viewed in nominal dollars and not in services received.
MylesUdland	714247212419649536	2016-03-28T00:26:20	NYCPunter and the entry-level supply will respond to the demand; what's easier: re-zoning an urban center or rebuilding existing suburbs?
