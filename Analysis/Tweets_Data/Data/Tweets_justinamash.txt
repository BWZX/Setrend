justinamash	718889036216020992	2016-04-09T19:51:17	JosiahVPopp Privacy doesn't work that way; not all or nothing.  4thAmendment is about reasonableness/prob cause/warrant, not expectations.
justinamash	718886039331282944	2016-04-09T19:39:22	JosiahVPopp You maintain rights in your person/property when someone else houses/stores/transports.  Depends on the terms of the agreement.

justinamash	709234287929905152	2016-03-14T04:26:45	MicahBriedwell That's right. We must be precise with language ("liberty to dance," not "freedom of dance") or we undermine natural rights.
justinamash	709201509007884288	2016-03-14T02:16:30	jm_cook Nope. Others are suggesting "free speech" protections against non-government actors. That implies they support "free speech" laws.
justinamash	709171928095973377	2016-03-14T00:18:58	If protesters violently disrupt Swan Lake, nobody calls it a violation of the freedom of dance. May be trespass, disorderly conduct, etc.
justinamash	709142570979426304	2016-03-13T22:22:18	evanbernick We are arguing semantics. My point is that the phrase "freedom of" is misleading in non-government context. ariarmstrong
justinamash	709139027203588097	2016-03-13T22:08:13	MaximusEuropa You are, in my view, conflating natural right of speech or contractual right to speak at venue with concept of "free speech."
justinamash	709136026397237249	2016-03-13T21:56:18	evanbernick Natural rights not ordinarily described as "freedom of." Constitution includes phrase bc of relationship to govt. ariarmstrong
justinamash	709127646853124096	2016-03-13T21:23:00	ariarmstrong I think the disagreement stems from my distinguishing between the natural right of "speech" and "freedom of speech."
justinamash	709125401952571392	2016-03-13T21:14:05	MaximusEuropa But that remedy would not be to address violation of "free speech" but rather to address other crimes/torts (e.g., trespass).
justinamash	709122844408545280	2016-03-13T21:03:55	MaximusEuropa In your mind, Trump's "freedom of speech" was violated. (I disagree.) What does that mean practically and what is the remedy?
justinamash	709120930174341120	2016-03-13T20:56:19	MaximusEuropa So, if a protester punches someone in the face at a Trump rally, the criminal charge will be "violating free speech"?
justinamash	709119296924950528	2016-03-13T20:49:49	How about his unconstitutional war? 
justinamash	709118885337952256	2016-03-13T20:48:11	MaximusEuropa You mentioned motive. Criminal violation is assault, battery, etc. Stopping a speech is motive. No separate penalty for that.

justinamash	708735159567261697	2016-03-12T19:23:24	Correct. It might be assault, battery, or some other crime under state law, but it's not a 1stAmendment violation.

justinamash	708561417209679872	2016-03-12T07:53:00	That would not be a violation of my freedom of speech. That would be trespassing and perhaps assault and battery.

justinamash	708547099751817216	2016-03-12T06:56:07	Protesters may be violating Trump's property rights; some may be committing illegal acts of violence. Not 1A issue.

justinamash	708539772537593857	2016-03-12T06:27:00	Under 1stAmendment, Trump rallies don't have to be open to public; he can remove people; AND protests do not violate his freedom of speech.
justinamash	708536226475872256	2016-03-12T06:12:55	No, it does not say that. If Trump were to block someone on Twitter, for example, that's not a 1stAmendment issue. 
justinamash	708513139185164288	2016-03-12T04:41:10	You seriously did not know that? Pick up a copy of the Constitution sometime and grab one for realDonaldTrump, too.

justinamash	696428294317678592	2016-02-07T20:20:19	A debate (or a town hall) isn't a speech. Rubio constantly reframes Q to incorporate memorized script into response.
