indiviglio	710182290236841984	2016-03-16T19:13:47	Wait. When was it on the radar?  
indiviglio	687334512825503744	2016-01-13T18:04:52	So is this giant AB InBev debt deal just for refinancing or does it imply they're going to be buying dozens of craft breweries this year?

indiviglio	687300732802879488	2016-01-13T15:50:38	My old EY colleague bigmeangreen shared this insane pic from thomsonreuters (he uses TR for CPE). Guys, really? 
indiviglio	679335955757555713	2015-12-22T16:21:27	So if Dec's # doesn't turn out very strong, this theory is wrong. FWIW, our Nov. home sale closed easily in 30 days. 
indiviglio	679334075933450240	2015-12-22T16:13:59	Anecdotal, but I'd blame weak home sales on low inventory. Market was dead in Oct/Nov. That helped our NoVA home sell in 4 days.
indiviglio	679332780388433921	2015-12-22T16:08:50	"Oh, there are new mortgage forms as part of the closing paperwork? We better not buy a house!" - No one ever.
indiviglio	679332558551703552	2015-12-22T16:07:58	Sorry NAR, blaming new loan forms for Nov's 19-mth low of exist. home sales is absurd. We just bought/sold homes - new forms not a big deal.

indiviglio	677218817970331649	2015-12-16T20:08:42	Yellen: For economic expansions, age is just a number.
indiviglio	677217107516362752	2015-12-16T20:01:55	KevinAllison Not exactly. Short vs medium vs long-term expectations could be treated differently.
indiviglio	677216316831326208	2015-12-16T19:58:46	Yellen seems to be saying that if inflation expectations (to 1.6% by EOY 2016) fail to be realized, they'll slow down normalization.
indiviglio	677211859032780800	2015-12-16T19:41:03	Shorter Yellen: We're moving now because we want smoother economic cycles instead of choppier ones.

indiviglio	664841537537204224	2015-11-12T16:25:49	Yesterday, someone told me I looked like Ben Bernanke. Not exactly a compliment, but better than if they said Volcker, Greenspan or Yellen.
