COdendahl	723139865265733632	2016-04-21T13:22:33	If old times are any guide, Trichet should have freaked OUT about commodity-prices-induced deflation.  
COdendahl	723138773484183552	2016-04-21T13:18:13	Indeed. As Milton Friedman would have said: a symptom of tight monetary policy.

COdendahl	722490334714937345	2016-04-19T18:21:33	clareswift604 I know, lots of mistakes there. But nothing to do with UK, and no reason to leave.
COdendahl	722490246940770304	2016-04-19T18:21:12	clareswift604 and UK did... what? All on its own?
COdendahl	722490158550016001	2016-04-19T18:20:51	sarahdukip I was kidding, obviously. Gotta run.
COdendahl	722489955189190656	2016-04-19T18:20:03	sarahdukip WHAT?! No, that's nonsense.
COdendahl	722489845671665665	2016-04-19T18:19:37	clareswift604 yes, euro is a big problem, indeed, and in part reason for that. But also national reasons, of course.
COdendahl	722489741573296128	2016-04-19T18:19:12	clareswift604 Cologne attacks? What a nonsense.
COdendahl	722489627614060548	2016-04-19T18:18:45	sarahdukip nah, I only do euros. :)
COdendahl	722489564053512192	2016-04-19T18:18:29	clareswift604 EU is not failing, but struggling, of course. Problems are enormous. But not caused by EU.
COdendahl	722489083281465345	2016-04-19T18:16:35	sarahdukip UK is out of monetary union and always will be, regardless of Brexit or not.
COdendahl	722488995058462722	2016-04-19T18:16:14	sarahdukip wanna bet? :)
COdendahl	722488930218721280	2016-04-19T18:15:58	DeborahPTodd65 I am not on any gravy train, but you are falling for populist nonsense that "all problems are caused by EU" That's just sad.
COdendahl	722488740485197824	2016-04-19T18:15:13	DeborahPTodd65 I am not an expert on fishing, I am sorry.
COdendahl	722488660424323073	2016-04-19T18:14:54	DeborahPTodd65 EU immigrants: showed you the data; membership fee tiny compared to econ benefits; bailing out: what bail out?
COdendahl	722488294299287552	2016-04-19T18:13:27	clareswift604 no, which problems DID it cause. That might be fewer...
COdendahl	722488213265387521	2016-04-19T18:13:07	clareswift604 I am very certain that CH exports a lot more to EU than the RoW.
COdendahl	722487921958383616	2016-04-19T18:11:58	clareswift604 EU is blamed for a lot of problems that it didn't cause. Sad that you fall so easily for that.
COdendahl	722487788420116480	2016-04-19T18:11:26	DeborahPTodd65 there are many many decisions being taken, often by consensus. So your metric does not show what's really going on.
COdendahl	722487493162070020	2016-04-19T18:10:16	sarahdukip Britain always had interest in stability on continent. very sad to read that this sense is lost. And you want a "fair deal"...
COdendahl	722487356008370176	2016-04-19T18:09:43	clareswift604 ?! Switzerland exports to one state of Germany more than to all BRICS combined.
COdendahl	722487241361199104	2016-04-19T18:09:16	sarahdukip then you have a problem with securing access to EU single market. Germany will *never* agree to UK access w/o free movement.
COdendahl	722487104027148288	2016-04-19T18:08:43	DeborahPTodd65 Right back at you.  
COdendahl	722486591608995841	2016-04-19T18:06:41	sarahdukip that will backfire...
COdendahl	722486519144046592	2016-04-19T18:06:23	DeborahPTodd65 no, it's not. Look at the data.
COdendahl	722486312088027136	2016-04-19T18:05:34	clareswift604 they are trying to ignore the referendum at the moment, as there is no chance to implement it without violating treaties.
COdendahl	722486185025736705	2016-04-19T18:05:04	DeborahPTodd65 now you are exaggerating a bit. Which problem of you or your community, was caused by EU? I am genuinely curious.
COdendahl	722485840723709953	2016-04-19T18:03:42	clareswift604 no no, the Swiss had a referendum on that, rejected free movement, and EU refuses to accept that. Swiss now have huge problem
COdendahl	722485639346855936	2016-04-19T18:02:54	sarahdukip BMW sells cars to the US with a 10% tariff, they will be fine. Margins huge. :)
COdendahl	722485463068581896	2016-04-19T18:02:12	DeborahPTodd65 EU laws are agreed among 28 countries, of course there needs to be compromise.
COdendahl	722485345238061056	2016-04-19T18:01:44	DeborahPTodd65 most migration came from outside EU, over which UK would have had control. Not EU's fault.
COdendahl	722485125884309505	2016-04-19T18:00:51	sarahdukip why "penalise"? The EU has the 4 freedoms, and wants access to single market go hand in hand with those. That's fair.
COdendahl	722484926990434304	2016-04-19T18:00:04	sarahdukip you underestimate the politics of countries like France and Germany. It's very risky, Merkel has other things to worry about.
COdendahl	722484499263655941	2016-04-19T17:58:22	clareswift604 free movement of people.
COdendahl	722484463452729344	2016-04-19T17:58:13	clareswift604 as I've said, ask the Swiss. They struggle with their EU a la carte to secure services deal. And, by the way, have to accept
COdendahl	722484296905269249	2016-04-19T17:57:34	DeborahPTodd65 and you have stayed British, have you not? I understand that it is not only about the economics of it. But that matters.
COdendahl	722484179863269376	2016-04-19T17:57:06	sarahdukip they don't, no. In fact, for goods, both sides will want to agree an FTA of sorts. For services? No way.
COdendahl	722483820868595712	2016-04-19T17:55:40	sarahdukip WTO trade is what "nothing" stands for, obviously.
COdendahl	722483695068848128	2016-04-19T17:55:10	clareswift604 I agree, so my sense is that an FTA on goods trade is feasible for UK. But services? Very hard. Ask Swiss.
COdendahl	722482668823318528	2016-04-19T17:51:05	clareswift604 Hollande, who is NOT for leaving EU, will not want to help UK with a sweet deal, as that would help Front National etc
COdendahl	722482526799790081	2016-04-19T17:50:32	clareswift604 ahaha, ok, you are now being silly. I am out.
COdendahl	722482283245125633	2016-04-19T17:49:34	clareswift604 and giving Uk a good deal is good for French politicians (!) why?
COdendahl	722482182183366656	2016-04-19T17:49:09	clareswift604 Right, have you ever checked a German opinion poll on that issue? Apparently not.
COdendahl	722481723301355520	2016-04-19T17:47:20	DeborahPTodd65 yes, have your pop at the Fritz... But you haven't answered my question: why can Germany, and not UK trade with RoW in EU?
COdendahl	722481480509886464	2016-04-19T17:46:22	hetty_getty DeborahPTodd65 we are not EU funded.
COdendahl	722481451334266886	2016-04-19T17:46:15	clareswift604 what do you think a French voter or German will think about UK leaving? You are naive.
COdendahl	722481132110028800	2016-04-19T17:44:59	lostleonardo ISO standards? Really? You think that is what makes the single market and EEA? That's nonsense.
COdendahl	722480669562118145	2016-04-19T17:43:09	DeborahPTodd65 even more entertaining: the FTA btw EU and India is stuck because of ... the French? No. The UK.
COdendahl	722480474438963200	2016-04-19T17:42:22	DeborahPTodd65 interesting, my home country (Germany) seems to be quite good at it, so cannot really be EU holding UK back...
COdendahl	722480295933583365	2016-04-19T17:41:40	clareswift604 I was taking it to the extreme, of course. My hope is an FTA, yes. But it's not the same as full single market access.
COdendahl	722479449464246272	2016-04-19T17:38:18	EUAreKidding haha, good one.
COdendahl	722479165035974656	2016-04-19T17:37:10	clareswift604 so you'd give up market access for 44% of your exports? That is economically silly.
COdendahl	722478892573933568	2016-04-19T17:36:05	DeborahPTodd65 don't mix up trade deficit with exports as a whole (which matter). Trade deficit also a capital financing problem for UK.
COdendahl	722478257153695744	2016-04-19T17:33:34	clareswift604 WhiteWednesday actually, we do. We also take EU supply chains for RoW into account, that UK supplies.
COdendahl	722477123240398849	2016-04-19T17:29:03	EFTA4UK that is not the argument in the piece, read it carefully. You ignore the politics of France, Germany and others.
COdendahl	722476974959149056	2016-04-19T17:28:28	lostleonardo you are fooling yourself. EEA means UK has almost all rights and obligations as under EU, just no say in anything.
COdendahl	722476743836246017	2016-04-19T17:27:33	clareswift604 WhiteWednesday ok, let's look at the numbers. UK exports 50% of its goods to EU. EU only 8% to UK.

COdendahl	709098333592285185	2016-03-13T19:26:31	BBCGavinHewitt in fact, CDU losses in Saxony-Anhalt very small, considering the surge in AfD.
