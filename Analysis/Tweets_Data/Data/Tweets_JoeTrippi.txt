JoeTrippi	687288955947978752	2016-01-13T15:03:50	9/ until he does that (and we won't know until South Carolina and beyond) he is still not a threat to win nomination let alone the General.
JoeTrippi	687288631304650752	2016-01-13T15:02:33	8/ What so far has not happened is Sanders gaining any traction with Democrats in Hillary's areas of strength women, blacks and others.
JoeTrippi	687288211987550213	2016-01-13T15:00:53	7/ Clinton goes us and down in polls (in relation to Bernie) as white progressives and younger voters flaot between the two.
JoeTrippi	687287429250682880	2016-01-13T14:57:46	6/ No one should be surprised by Bernie's strength in Iowa or NH - the surprise will be if he can expand to minorities and others after.
JoeTrippi	687287024936595457	2016-01-13T14:56:10	5/ You can not win the nomination with just Bernie's share of the coalition -- and you can't win the General without both parts.
JoeTrippi	687286616423989248	2016-01-13T14:54:33	4/ But after Iowa and NY it is Hillary Clinton's part of the coalition that leads the way to the nomination.
JoeTrippi	687285430782312449	2016-01-13T14:49:50	3/ It is possible for Sanders to win Iowa and New Hampshire with just the groups he leads with.
JoeTrippi	687284343539011584	2016-01-13T14:45:31	2/ Clinton leads Sanders among women, and minorities while getting a fair share of progressives and blue collar whites.
JoeTrippi	687283310582575108	2016-01-13T14:41:25	1/ Democratic Primary Reality.  The Obama coalition is split.  Sanders leads Clinton among white progressives and younger Democrats.
