SoBendito	698985854958702592	2016-02-14T21:43:09	georgepearkes definitely. Very few people realize that all their precious tax expenditures are subsidies.

SoBendito	698950275374125057	2016-02-14T19:21:46	MarketUrbanism thecitywanderer maybe but that would also hit market rents, which would complicate cross subsidy
SoBendito	698950069140254721	2016-02-14T19:20:57	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism Related started in affordable housing business too, and they still do some, but it's no longer bread&amp;butter
SoBendito	698949873488523264	2016-02-14T19:20:10	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism great way to build operational and dev infrastructure, but once they've got that, market rate becomes focus
SoBendito	698949661705560064	2016-02-14T19:19:19	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism and Jonathan Rose etc. they're all in the same position. AH dev is a fee generating business, so it's a 1/2
SoBendito	698949462136377344	2016-02-14T19:18:32	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism they used to but much of their pipeline now is market rate or largely market rate.

SoBendito	698946604225716224	2016-02-14T19:07:10	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism yea sure but the more regulated/subsidized it is, the less competition from efficient ~market rate dvlprs
SoBendito	698945889369485312	2016-02-14T19:04:20	MarketUrbanism thecitywanderer I wonder how much of drive for 50% was actually from the Affordable Housing Industrial Complex, not tenants
SoBendito	698945242079358976	2016-02-14T19:01:46	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism idk if even a Sanders administration could pull that off given where congress is at.
SoBendito	698944770077491200	2016-02-14T18:59:53	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism it's part of the solution but afaik it only fills a small portion of their financial hole.
SoBendito	698943981548339202	2016-02-14T18:56:45	MarketUrbanism thecitywanderer indeed, long term financing is an open question but even if unanswered new bldgs would take longer to decay
SoBendito	698943525925294080	2016-02-14T18:54:56	MarketUrbanism thecitywanderer subsidies (both $$ and density) would be necessary, but better to subsidize new bldgs than old imo
SoBendito	698942656156737536	2016-02-14T18:51:29	thecitywanderer MarketUrbanism I think for it to work they'd have to build new units for existing tenants, move them in, and then raze.
