robferdman	725102304169480193	2016-04-26T23:20:35	freddiedeboer the ‚Äúpiece‚Äù is a conversation with an academic who just published a book that is dripping with data.
robferdman	725094546615504897	2016-04-26T22:49:46	Nothing like ‚Äúan academic‚Äù disparaging your piece by citing anecdotal evidence. Not everyone pays attention in class

robferdman	725092628019204096	2016-04-26T22:42:08	freddiedeboer no reason to be sorry. you should just make stronger arguments. also, you might want to consider talking to Krishnendu Ray
robferdman	725092287521382405	2016-04-26T22:40:47	freddiedeboer the only tautological argument being waged is your own. you are assuming the data doesn‚Äôt exist, noting anecdotal evidence
robferdman	725092028741197824	2016-04-26T22:39:45	freddiedeboer we discussed why Japanese food, which was once something Americans were less willing to pay for, has transcended that
robferdman	725091507422806016	2016-04-26T22:37:41	freddiedeboer Japanese food is discussed
robferdman	725091329089376262	2016-04-26T22:36:59	freddiedeboer based on your anecdotal evidence?
robferdman	725091123715276808	2016-04-26T22:36:10	freddiedeboer the Japanese cuisine quirk is discussed in the interview
robferdman	725091015456083969	2016-04-26T22:35:44	freddiedeboer pizza isn‚Äôt the comparison, though. Italian would be. Momofuku is an exception and Nobu is Japanese, not considered ethnic
robferdman	725090304920047616	2016-04-26T22:32:54	freddiedeboer I‚Äôm sure there are exceptions to the rule/outliers
robferdman	725090249458745344	2016-04-26T22:32:41	freddiedeboer it‚Äôs broad, across the US, but also city-specific. his point is that the higher end hasn‚Äôt developed for these cuisines
robferdman	725089834965028865	2016-04-26T22:31:02	freddiedeboer yes, the data is cited at length in his book, The Ethnic Restaurateur
robferdman	725076967691788293	2016-04-26T21:39:55	aw, Ted Cruz thinks he can win the national election. that's cute.

robferdman	725007488467275776	2016-04-26T17:03:49	wingzero98 there is even a reluctance to pay more for what drives the prices of other cuisines up, things like organic meat and veggies
robferdman	725007330048413697	2016-04-26T17:03:12	wingzero98 point wasn't that it needs to be consistent with what makes other cuisines expensive. just that there is no high end
robferdman	725006228804521984	2016-04-26T16:58:49	wingzero98 of course. point is not that all food should cost more, but rather that the higher end has not developed here

robferdman	724433963989766144	2016-04-25T03:04:51	cricketcrocker i don‚Äôt think your argument is nearly as nuanced as you believe it to be.
robferdman	724433186659414016	2016-04-25T03:01:45	cricketcrocker it is neither. i think you‚Äôre conflating a comment about broader trends with an argument about individual behavior patterns
robferdman	724432466388365312	2016-04-25T02:58:53	cricketcrocker the article was not about upper/middlecass white millennial food preferences. it was about broad industry trends.

robferdman	723974860859400193	2016-04-23T20:40:32	dhunt245 i take that as compliment! thank you
robferdman	723974803795902464	2016-04-23T20:40:18	dhunt245 the point was really just that the high end of these cuisines hasn't developed, and that says something about our perception
robferdman	723973246664753154	2016-04-23T20:34:07	dhunt245 anyway, I don't find your argument very convincing, but I appreciate that you took the time to read the piece.

robferdman	723649673840451584	2016-04-22T23:08:21	wonderchul that‚Äôs a very fair point. (the D electorate is actually expected to be mostly non-white by 2020)
robferdman	723641194430009345	2016-04-22T22:34:40	FlyDTW Fahrenthold RasikaDC I would argue that that is anecdotal evidence. There are exceptions, but the broader reality persists
robferdman	723640890884001792	2016-04-22T22:33:27	wonderchul but the overarching trend is observable, and the product of our collective being. does that make sense?
robferdman	723640782985564161	2016-04-22T22:33:01	wonderchul when I say ‚Äúwe,‚Äù I mean ‚Äúwe as a society,‚Äù collectively. there are exceptions, of course‚Äîit is not a hard fast rule.

robferdman	723640153395335170	2016-04-22T22:30:31	wonderchul but most restaurants we call ‚Äúethnic‚Äù are located in urban areas and trends observed in cities like New York tend to trickle out
robferdman	723639850835042304	2016-04-22T22:29:19	wonderchul I agree that the broad picture is misleading in certain ways, and that many immigrant-Americans experience food differently
robferdman	723639477126742016	2016-04-22T22:27:50	wonderchul I see what you mean, but when I talk about Americans I‚Äôm talking about Americans on the whole, collectively, not individually
