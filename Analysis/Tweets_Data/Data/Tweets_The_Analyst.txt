The_Analyst	696229277445046273	2016-02-07T07:09:29	DudaFanClub also absurd is that I was able to take out as much in loans as I did. 0 underwriting standards or checks on borrowers

The_Analyst	696227851671101440	2016-02-07T07:03:49	srhbutts balajis one has to be fairly popular and/or say something fairly spectacular to get wrath of this global mob of which you speak
The_Analyst	696226658970423296	2016-02-07T06:59:05	DudaFanClub I think we can agree there's an issue if I'm coming out of a school like I did, with that much in loans, &amp; have trouble paying
The_Analyst	696226155800748032	2016-02-07T06:57:05	DudaFanClub so I'm in like the 99.9th percentile of those with student loan debt, so I am very, very aware of how much it blows

The_Analyst	696224161375637504	2016-02-07T06:49:09	DudaFanClub I'm aware
The_Analyst	696224024758767617	2016-02-07T06:48:37	DudaFanClub I'm not saying some should or shouldn't, depends on each person's preferences. Make it free seems to imply everyone should go?

The_Analyst	696223526886510592	2016-02-07T06:46:38	DudaFanClub So is the assumption that tradespeople, homemakers, folks who just don't want to...should go to 4-yr college?

The_Analyst	696222766568247296	2016-02-07T06:43:37	MBaddie7 prime1133 fact that I got through undergrad and bschool at pretty decent universities w/ &gt;3.0 is testament to that!
The_Analyst	696222463148081152	2016-02-07T06:42:25	DudaFanClub why has tuition grown so much so fast? Limitless supply of non-underwritten loans from govt is a pretty darn big driver, no?
The_Analyst	696222361054552064	2016-02-07T06:42:00	DudaFanClub I think we should take this one step at a time and drive it decisions with data/analysis not ideology and feelings, eg

The_Analyst	696221462638784512	2016-02-07T06:38:26	DudaFanClub We are not Denmark, though. Let's not start that discussion.
The_Analyst	696221145327132672	2016-02-07T06:37:10	DudaFanClub I'm not making a thiel argument. I just don't think making public universities free is the best way to go about anything
The_Analyst	696221000380366851	2016-02-07T06:36:36	DudaFanClub seems better way then is to impose tuition increase limitations, jack up need-based govt grants (not loans), not make it free

The_Analyst	696220449840173056	2016-02-07T06:34:25	DudaFanClub his plan is based on idea that high school isn't good enough, everyone needs 4 more years of schooling?
The_Analyst	696220136043315201	2016-02-07T06:33:10	prime1133 MBaddie7 if you make something free, people are going to do it, especially if it means putting off work for 4 more years
The_Analyst	696219904006098944	2016-02-07T06:32:14	DudaFanClub make college free! aka make bachellors degrees even more useless.
The_Analyst	696219827090931712	2016-02-07T06:31:56	DudaFanClub he doesn't seem to have considered any 2nd+ order effects of any of his policies
The_Analyst	696219487645913092	2016-02-07T06:30:35	MBaddie7 it's basically making college 13th-16th grades w/masters degrees the new undergrad degrees. Subsidy for education sector thats all
The_Analyst	696219133671829504	2016-02-07T06:29:11	DudaFanClub yea saw that. sounds great in theory, well, ok. Also ignores as Ryan_Dunton "wall street money" is our money
The_Analyst	696218775448915968	2016-02-07T06:27:45	DudaFanClub I like the sentiment of some of his social ideas but complete lack of remotely practical econ/tax policies is a big problem no?
The_Analyst	696218482183172096	2016-02-07T06:26:35	"ending Wall Street speculation" at best relies on coming to an agreement on what is/isnt "speculation" which is an eternal debate already
The_Analyst	696217560765853696	2016-02-07T06:22:56	DudaFanClub You know as well as I any such thing would be massively contested as it has been and at best nowhere near level he wants
The_Analyst	696217364501807104	2016-02-07T06:22:09	"Tax Wall Street speculation!" sounds great but it's so vague it's like "I have a money tree, don't worry!" not much less silly
