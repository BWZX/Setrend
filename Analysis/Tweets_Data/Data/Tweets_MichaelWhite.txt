MichaelWhite	726072962336624640	2016-04-29T15:37:38	Yes, but how "fundamental" is the problem? I addressed this yesterday and must now have my tea 
MichaelWhite	726072746384494592	2016-04-29T15:36:47	In fairness to the Daily Mail it will throw shit at (almost) anyone in politics, it's popular and convenient.

MichaelWhite	726070740961902593	2016-04-29T15:28:49	a very stupid comment, Brian. Trouble these days is that politicians can scarcely take a piss without it on YouTube

MichaelWhite	726068619864621056	2016-04-29T15:20:23	I have spent the last 24 hours here calling Ken an egotist, idiot and ill informed in this. Is that enough for you? 
MichaelWhite	726068402310275072	2016-04-29T15:19:31	No and that is both a stupid and offensive comment. Shame on you 
MichaelWhite	726068255853518848	2016-04-29T15:18:56	No, that's a really stupid comment, smug too. Think a bit harder 
MichaelWhite	726068021467426816	2016-04-29T15:18:00	Yes we know Ken's got form, but why was he goaded into  elephant trap now. Because Shah's old comments were dug up 
MichaelWhite	726067759847772164	2016-04-29T15:16:58	No, but Shah's comments were made in 2014, only trotted out now. These guys have a bulging file of shite 
MichaelWhite	726067602968207362	2016-04-29T15:16:20	I don't think I said "the government" did it. I fingered Guido Staines and "Sir" Bing Crosby who is running Zac G

MichaelWhite	726066003130593281	2016-04-29T15:09:59	tommyjcrane Because Shah's remarks were made in 2014 and conveniently controversial just before a sensitive election in 2016
MichaelWhite	726065814198169603	2016-04-29T15:09:14	Ask yourself, who decided that Shah comments made in 2014 are suddenly important in election week 2014 ?

MichaelWhite	726064875550683136	2016-04-29T15:05:30	Tell me why Shah's comments, made in 2014, are suddenly news in election week, oh wise one? 
MichaelWhite	726064558813667328	2016-04-29T15:04:15	You are half right. Some Labour Corbyn bashers did fall for it, most people know when to calm things down

MichaelWhite	726062621678514176	2016-04-29T14:56:33	It is the crux of the matter. Why did Shah comments made in 2014 suddenly become news days before polling in 2016 ? 
MichaelWhite	726062387443458048	2016-04-29T14:55:37	susiesharkles You mean well Susan, but ask why MP Shah's comments in 2014 suddenly became Tory "news" a week before polling day ?

MichaelWhite	718486843164135424	2016-04-08T17:13:06	Bernie Sanders is giving Hilary a  Corbynish hard time. Here's interesting challenge 
MichaelWhite	718485191216537600	2016-04-08T17:06:33	Agreed 
MichaelWhite	718485058714255360	2016-04-08T17:06:01	It adopted me, a very common name in southern England, south west in my case

MichaelWhite	718484059719118848	2016-04-08T17:02:03	That's funnier, keep it up 
MichaelWhite	718483786749603841	2016-04-08T17:00:58	I thought you &amp; I had politely agreed to differ? Give it a rest or i might start getting feisty 
MichaelWhite	718483405181231104	2016-04-08T16:59:27	Hoopsdips stpaulthemason I do now, thanks, and am mightily relieved
MichaelWhite	718483107410808832	2016-04-08T16:58:16	I agree, but that bold advocacy needs to command public trust, voters &amp; (cowed) bankers. How many economists could? 
MichaelWhite	718464259622047744	2016-04-08T15:43:22	Oh Paul, a clever bloke like you will have to do much better than Lego brick Tweets against "neoliberalism"  
MichaelWhite	718463875738386433	2016-04-08T15:41:51	I do think about it a great deal, but it's ok to disagree 
MichaelWhite	718463661589819392	2016-04-08T15:40:59	It may, but I very much doubt it. A little perhaps over tax avoidance. We all want other people to pay more 
MichaelWhite	718463416520806400	2016-04-08T15:40:01	Yes, many good people in  Labour party, they will have to be patient until voters have passed judgment on Corbynism 
MichaelWhite	718463103663534083	2016-04-08T15:38:46	Dave has been learning how to clean up his own shit all week. He's slowly getting the hang of it

MichaelWhite	718462401016938496	2016-04-08T15:35:59	This is a morally important insight

MichaelWhite	718462039702839296	2016-04-08T15:34:33	Paul, am slowly beginning to suspect you are trying to say you are a member of Labour's Reality Based community Yes? 
MichaelWhite	718461552324702209	2016-04-08T15:32:37	It's true I did once go to Eton, but when I realised i had taken the wrong turn I drove back to Slough

MichaelWhite	718460902408921088	2016-04-08T15:30:02	This isn't true, Two Lens, as you must realise. I'm not just saying that because it's Craig Murray either 
MichaelWhite	718460481678270464	2016-04-08T15:28:21	You're either tone deaf or not getting my point. But I realise you care, so thanks and best wishes 
MichaelWhite	718460289755295745	2016-04-08T15:27:36	Yep, that's the problem in a brick nutshell

MichaelWhite	718414865711439873	2016-04-08T12:27:06	Ok 
MichaelWhite	718414728977117184	2016-04-08T12:26:33	One refinement of the joke which is also fun is " a bachelor, but not a confirmed one." best wishes 
MichaelWhite	718414358250942464	2016-04-08T12:25:05	Hugh, Lord Gannex eventually came to a sticky end, as i recall 
MichaelWhite	718414162079166464	2016-04-08T12:24:18	You're doing well, Sean, good on you. The disappointment was largely economic 
MichaelWhite	718413806918070272	2016-04-08T12:22:53	Yes, Jenkins was a reforming home sec, and Harold, a socially cautious Yorkshireman, was very suspicious of him

MichaelWhite	718413302657847296	2016-04-08T12:20:53	That's a very stupid comment, Paul, so I hope it's what passes nowadays for irony. A dangerous device irony 
MichaelWhite	718412987816611840	2016-04-08T12:19:38	You'd better believe it... 
MichaelWhite	718310736368439299	2016-04-08T05:33:19	magl_williams All fair points , but if you were around at the time you felt disappointed. Clever people overwhelmed by events
MichaelWhite	718310133776969729	2016-04-08T05:30:56	BarrySheerman Yes indeed, but Jim led cabinet/PLP revolt against TU reform &amp; later paid price, as did we all: Thatcherism
MichaelWhite	718305431249096705	2016-04-08T05:12:14	"Confirmed bachelor" is another of those phrases which still make me laugh, but aren't mean. Do others agree? 
MichaelWhite	718305111857053696	2016-04-08T05:10:58	BarrySheerman We were both around, Barry. I admire your loyalty, but I was far from alone in disappointment. In Place of Strife? Oh dear

MichaelWhite	718303329198153728	2016-04-08T05:03:53	Yes, the OU was one of the enduring successes of the 1964/70 Wilson Labour government, there were not too many, alas

MichaelWhite	718040549949890560	2016-04-07T11:39:42	You've lost me there, I'm afraid. An irony car crash perhaps ? 
MichaelWhite	718040376263766017	2016-04-07T11:39:00	That's not quite right, though flaunting a PhD often tempts loved ones to tease a little, I imagine. I'm fond of Fi

MichaelWhite	718034263116017664	2016-04-07T11:14:43	Clever Jane Austen did not feel need to list qualifications on her brass plate in Winchester Cathedral. That's style

MichaelWhite	717656687348477952	2016-04-06T10:14:22	HEATHERNEWS1 I agree with that. Which is why I was so startled by the aggressive tone of the intervention on George Bell. No offence meant

MichaelWhite	707608009044844544	2016-03-09T16:44:30	It's Twitter for God's sake. If I write a PhD it may be longer 
MichaelWhite	707598236161331202	2016-03-09T16:05:40	I think OPEC was entitled to try it on 
MichaelWhite	707594359001247744	2016-03-09T15:50:16	Only themselves 
MichaelWhite	707594256987394048	2016-03-09T15:49:51	So is the French Republic but both concerns will soldier on 
MichaelWhite	707593905903161344	2016-03-09T15:48:28	Nato ? UN ? WTO ? Hague, Geneva etc conventions, do grow up 
MichaelWhite	707593563123675137	2016-03-09T15:47:06	I wdn't boast about being a bond dealer in 00s, Godders. Your pal, BoE's S'wervyn King didn't do too well either 
MichaelWhite	707593193693519873	2016-03-09T15:45:38	Bond dealer, politician, social drinker, now a military strategist too, is there no end to Godfrey's talent ? 
MichaelWhite	707592828411633664	2016-03-09T15:44:11	Yes, but we are wisely not part of them, we make all our own mistakes. Unmanly to name others, I'd say 
MichaelWhite	707592545753235456	2016-03-09T15:43:03	Oh really, you must be an investment banker domiciled abroad for tax purposes? 
MichaelWhite	707592288323633152	2016-03-09T15:42:02	Yes and communist China was still trying to make communism work in those days. ice much easier for rest of us 
MichaelWhite	707591822646898688	2016-03-09T15:40:11	Oh, but it's not going bust. Sorry to disappoint 
MichaelWhite	707591486012039168	2016-03-09T15:38:51	Win or lose, the Mail normally declares victory and moves on its campaign (might say it has always been pro EU) 
MichaelWhite	707590825543389184	2016-03-09T15:36:13	Contrast Longworth martyrdom with Mail hysteria over BoE's Carney  . Unfair says Nils Pratley 
MichaelWhite	707588343782105088	2016-03-09T15:26:22	BCC's Longworth paid to rep BCC which is tactfully neutral on Brexit (though 60% pro EU). Becomes Daily Mail martyr  
MichaelWhite	707554744064188416	2016-03-09T13:12:51	Not lately, I stopped wasting both our time some years ago 
MichaelWhite	707554575222489088	2016-03-09T13:12:11	I understand your position and respect it. I do not respect many who have climbed on board or their remedies.Regards

MichaelWhite	707553753604497408	2016-03-09T13:08:55	that's right, but it's OUR own collective fault, not Brussels. That's just an excuse 
MichaelWhite	707553569352884224	2016-03-09T13:08:11	Yes, those EU buggers have (irony alert) stopped us building the third runway, Crossrail, Hinkley Point etc. Swine! 
MichaelWhite	707553249231028224	2016-03-09T13:06:54	Is that true? What a hoot  
MichaelWhite	707553162400505856	2016-03-09T13:06:34	Thanks you for sharing Greg. Now back to your GCSE homework !!

MichaelWhite	707552761852895237	2016-03-09T13:04:58	That's a fair jibe, well above average. Mind you, Goldmans would work for the Devill for a fee 
MichaelWhite	707552560178196480	2016-03-09T13:04:10	That is a better way of putting it

MichaelWhite	707551827093561344	2016-03-09T13:01:15	who's this "global power" you're on about now, Brian? Have you taken Chinese citizenship? How's your Mandarin? 
MichaelWhite	707551297885626368	2016-03-09T12:59:09	Everyone knows German autobahns were built by the Tooth Fairy. Go to the back of the class 
MichaelWhite	707551163026112512	2016-03-09T12:58:37	Not smug at all, terrified that Trump, Le Pen, Little Nigel etc may make a scary situation MUCH worse 
MichaelWhite	707550936936357888	2016-03-09T12:57:43	Watch out folks, Brian the cocky Brexiter is keen on "Darwinian economy" 
MichaelWhite	707550715686866944	2016-03-09T12:56:50	That's not quite what nepotism means. I think we call it upward mobility nowadays, but I agree, a touch of Trump  
MichaelWhite	707550409385230336	2016-03-09T12:55:37	Perhaps so, but only  voters can break the stalemate, we must be patient and respect JC's party mandate until then 
MichaelWhite	707550073400463360	2016-03-09T12:54:17	Maybe, but some Labour MPs tell me Corbynite wave doesn't turn up for constituency meetings or knock on doors

MichaelWhite	707549523623735297	2016-03-09T12:52:06	No, it's exactly the other way round. Brexit and Scexit types are the ones who need an alibi for difficulties 
MichaelWhite	707549197298503680	2016-03-09T12:50:48	My pleasure, be careful not to graze your knuckles on rough pavements 
MichaelWhite	707549034106458113	2016-03-09T12:50:10	Yes. I took the view that a currency needs a state and that the EU was/is not a state. Quite wise really 
MichaelWhite	707548790044155904	2016-03-09T12:49:11	Only by certain people in London. Real people know how important it is to win councils and deliver local services 
MichaelWhite	707548609907204101	2016-03-09T12:48:28	Not you again, please go away and bother people who are more easily misled

MichaelWhite	707547423355310080	2016-03-09T12:43:45	Greeks fiddled their data to join euro, Germans etc held noses &amp; let them, then did a Wonga with cheap loans 
MichaelWhite	707547122816696320	2016-03-09T12:42:34	always a good question, though British armies are manned by volunteers, most keen to do the job they're trained for

MichaelWhite	707546020696223744	2016-03-09T12:38:11	Glib comment. You have to ask yourself, sooner or later, whether the JC recipe can ever win an election.That's all 
MichaelWhite	707545644756541441	2016-03-09T12:36:41	Like many quite bright folk I am pro EU but anti euro &amp; Schengen. Alas, we rarely hear smart/honest Brexit points

MichaelWhite	707545036397871105	2016-03-09T12:34:16	Not true, I (&amp; others) have written about it. Here for eg  
MichaelWhite	707544276729786369	2016-03-09T12:31:15	A fair exchange rate point which many Germans are reluctant to admit. But self defeating economic model in long run

MichaelWhite	707542934326026241	2016-03-09T12:25:55	But they won't &amp; can't Geordie, as I keep telling you. Jeremy's party mandate can only be trumped by electorate's

MichaelWhite	707482252414947328	2016-03-09T08:24:48	Funny how the Germans have such a huge trade surplus, isn't it? EU doesn't seem to hold them back

MichaelWhite	698215219785498625	2016-02-12T18:40:55	Yes, interesting that Murdoch is conflicted on Trump. Part of his brain knows it's madness but flakey side loves it 
MichaelWhite	698214841929048064	2016-02-12T18:39:25	That's right . Major player Adolf Eichman in 1960 is one thing, low grade bit players in 2016 quite another 
MichaelWhite	698214355876364288	2016-02-12T18:37:29	Print was Luddite, but to say RM solved Fleet St's problems on the day the Indy stops printing is a bit tactless 
MichaelWhite	698214069938028544	2016-02-12T18:36:21	You could argue that, Greville Janner certainly would have done. To my mind frail witnesses make for frail justice

MichaelWhite	698212407555026946	2016-02-12T18:29:44	No, neither side very loveable. Print Ludditesd wd have killed off newspapers years ago, arrogant, insular, greedy 
MichaelWhite	698212144270176260	2016-02-12T18:28:42	A matter of judgement, but I have watched these old Nazi cases before. Aged victims long for their day in court

MichaelWhite	698211180842786820	2016-02-12T18:24:52	No, that's sentimental. Eddie Shah was new tech pioneer in UK. Printers foolish to take on RM, much bigger bastard

MichaelWhite	698089455907897344	2016-02-12T10:21:10	Don't be silly. Are you a Catholic priest by chance? 
MichaelWhite	698089166794575872	2016-02-12T10:20:01	Precisely. Visionaries are often hopeless on paperwork and structure. Vision is never enough 
MichaelWhite	698088806868787200	2016-02-12T10:18:36	Good question. Yes, I have fumbled stories I regret with hindsight. That's what made it a good un smug film.

MichaelWhite	698087979437420545	2016-02-12T10:15:18	Yes, she had vision, but needed tough managers and trustees to manage her and hard headed governments. Their failure 
MichaelWhite	698087742195032064	2016-02-12T10:14:22	Are you listening to programme Fartel, or just Farteling about? Kids Co was a disgrace, but does not invalidate her

MichaelWhite	698073067315163136	2016-02-12T09:16:03	Now, now Andy, pony tail jokes may be interpreted as an attack on an SNP MP and therefore in breach of rule
