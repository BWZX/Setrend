hunterwalk	701132212289327106	2016-02-20T19:52:00	magicsilicon it's an article focused on tech innovation, so the more/less relevant your career is to tech, the more/less true it is
hunterwalk	701131922655866881	2016-02-20T19:50:51	andknf i think the author is saying exactly that except acknowledging one approach is to think about cohorts of innovation

hunterwalk	698363574570213377	2016-02-13T04:30:25	rfradin joshelman jonathanjoseph ...&amp; as things level out, most of those who still swear it's different get killed. Some outliers exist.

hunterwalk	698362010224857089	2016-02-13T04:24:12	gregisenberg ok, so have any VCs you consider great expressed any concern about mkt? Are they just talking their book to get lower prices?
hunterwalk	698361635044327424	2016-02-13T04:22:43	rabois time to bust out my fav tweet... 
hunterwalk	698361361215041536	2016-02-13T04:21:38	gregisenberg right but as an entrepreneur why the fuck would you care what a bad VC says abt the market? I don't listen to bad founders...

hunterwalk	698357449565188096	2016-02-13T04:06:05	gregisenberg ..money chasing startups right now, that all VCs just trying to get a deal on the cheap wouldn't work IMO
hunterwalk	698357216693219328	2016-02-13T04:05:09	gregisenberg ...they have no real control over investments so want founders to generally be cautious w burn, etc but there's so much...
hunterwalk	698357035398639618	2016-02-13T04:04:26	gregisenberg i think VCs might talk abt downturn scenarios more than founders bec they see more broadly across the environment &amp;...
hunterwalk	698356880062611456	2016-02-13T04:03:49	gregisenberg no good VC wants founders to start playing defense unnecessarily. you don't make money by underpaying for avg company
