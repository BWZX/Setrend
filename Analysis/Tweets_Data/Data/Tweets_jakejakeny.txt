jakejakeny	704334516773638146	2016-02-29T15:56:49	weciv01 right. That's why I said: "truly privatize." Entire industry needs a lot of breathing room.
jakejakeny	704333984856203265	2016-02-29T15:54:42	weciv01 yes. most public transport projects in NYC-area come with a 1,000% price inflation vs. pvt. sector projects.

jakejakeny	697903646399426561	2016-02-11T22:02:50	carlfordjr NAFTA troublesome yes, but manufacturing now has much more regulation not less.
jakejakeny	697899774834511872	2016-02-11T21:47:27	carlfordjr Bernie would tax and regulate MORE. Disaster
jakejakeny	697899656878157824	2016-02-11T21:46:59	carlfordjr that's why Google can make billions and get taxed much less than an automaker with much lower profits.
jakejakeny	697899505769914369	2016-02-11T21:46:23	carlfordjr but govt has driven up the cost of manufacturing in this country by taxing and over regulating capital.
jakejakeny	697899215331180544	2016-02-11T21:45:13	carlfordjr for example, the most hurting class in America is the hourly wage earning class. And they need manufacturing jobs.
jakejakeny	697898969448505345	2016-02-11T21:44:15	carlfordjr but again, you have a good point about a broken system.
jakejakeny	697898262460817408	2016-02-11T21:41:26	carlfordjr Bernie's entire message is about blaming others. As a parent it's terrifying to hear that. I'm trying to teach responsibility.
jakejakeny	697897884704993284	2016-02-11T21:39:56	carlfordjr my only bottom line is more govt is not the young man's friend. and when candidates blame others for your problems, beware.
jakejakeny	697897583746879489	2016-02-11T21:38:44	carlfordjr colleges jacked up prices knowing govt loans were there. Seller charges what customer bears. School doesn't care about your debt
jakejakeny	697896933168381952	2016-02-11T21:36:09	carlfordjr companies come back when costs go down. Govt is driving up costs with rules and taxes that make it harder to hire the young
jakejakeny	697896587733942273	2016-02-11T21:34:47	carlfordjr what's fair? I'd say a 35% tax rate isn't fair. Cut it to 15% or 20% and watch the money come back. Jobs too.
jakejakeny	697896023230976000	2016-02-11T21:32:32	carlfordjr that's a fair point, especially about student debt now. But that's caused by the govt. govt won't fix it, only free market
jakejakeny	697895749296775169	2016-02-11T21:31:27	carlfordjr &amp; the corp inversion rip is ridiculous. Feds take in $250B per month; may lose $20B over 10 yrs on inversions. Phony outrage
jakejakeny	697895114656632832	2016-02-11T21:28:56	carlfordjr yes there are new challenges but in total this is still loads better than it was in the 1970s, 30s, etc.
