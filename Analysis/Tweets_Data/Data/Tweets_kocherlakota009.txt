kocherlakota009	726151291404226560	2016-04-29T20:48:53	albertobisin thus, after 13.3 use in 08, Cong. has imposed tighter restrictions on its implementation (Treas. Sec. approval).
kocherlakota009	726151028295536640	2016-04-29T20:47:51	albertobisin informing public ahead of time about tools (like neg. rates) would likely lead to more constraints on discretion, not fewer.
kocherlakota009	726150826130083840	2016-04-29T20:47:02	albertobisin ??? The use of 13.3 was clearly discretionary  The issue is: should Fed let public know discretionary tools b4 use?

kocherlakota009	726074949643948032	2016-04-29T15:45:32	albertobisin Fed. Res. Act is very complex ... reasonable to re-acquaint public with its contents before tool implementation.
kocherlakota009	726074623016718337	2016-04-29T15:44:14	albertobisin "tools" - not decisions. Creates distrust if Fed suddenly announces: btw, back in 19XX, you gave us the right to buy munis.

kocherlakota009	725819147783946240	2016-04-28T22:49:04	Prezntval BV POTUS Labor share is down slightly - so low GDP means wages are low compared to expectations.

kocherlakota009	725684272934326274	2016-04-28T13:53:07	AdamPlatt1999 Noahpinion for me, key is he seems to get critical connection between mon. pol. and fis. pol.  Does HRC?  2/2
kocherlakota009	725683903068037120	2016-04-28T13:51:39	AdamPlatt1999 Noahpinion agree - doesn't add up.  something's gotta give. Trump is already retreating from debt reduction 1/2

kocherlakota009	725313406006366208	2016-04-27T13:19:26	BlakeLavak as post says: low r tells us that doubling was insufficient.

kocherlakota009	722091639515254784	2016-04-18T15:57:17	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio In my model, if pi_T &lt; -2*r_nat and R_t &gt;=0 for all t, then pi_t falls exponentially as (T-t) grows.
kocherlakota009	722089369071448064	2016-04-18T15:48:16	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio Is there a mistake in the math in my slides? (Pls. use my model - not a version of it that u like better.)
kocherlakota009	722081865016963072	2016-04-18T15:18:26	IvanWerning Seems like there's little danger of that!  But - seriously - it could be that small changes could be enough ... we don't know.

kocherlakota009	722076428670525440	2016-04-18T14:56:50	dandolfa thx. I'm interested in this q: given 2007 data, what would be your model's f'cast density for GDP?
kocherlakota009	722075544360263680	2016-04-18T14:53:19	dandolfa 2 comms. 1. I worry you would've written similar post in '39.  2. low TFP growth might be due to low AD expectations.
kocherlakota009	722073894644031489	2016-04-18T14:46:46	dandolfa I was looking at your IDEAS listing - couldn't find the pre-07 paper of yours along these lines.  What's the reference?
kocherlakota009	722073592746418176	2016-04-18T14:45:34	dandolfa agree on this.  But that only helps with 2007-09 (maybe 10).
kocherlakota009	722070554623275008	2016-04-18T14:33:30	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio I don't think that's true in my fin. hor. model. See  for clear posing of Neo-F Q.
kocherlakota009	722067132427673601	2016-04-18T14:19:54	dandolfa as I say - like u, most acads seem comfortable with the models' understanding of current situation.
kocherlakota009	722066190441558017	2016-04-18T14:16:09	dandolfa did u have a model in 07 that put sig. prob. on such low growth, such low pi, and such low r for next 10 yrs?  But 1/2
kocherlakota009	722065253757009920	2016-04-18T14:12:26	phoxoskephalein dandolfa I think that's useful in 07-09 - but so little recovery and so little inf. since 09??
kocherlakota009	722064291373957124	2016-04-18T14:08:37	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio If you don't like ZLB as SS - see my NBER WP 22009 ... it has highly persistent stays (10+ yrs) at ZLB.
kocherlakota009	722062667519782913	2016-04-18T14:02:09	dandolfa In US: 2007 GDP is dwn over 10% rel. to 2007 f'cast. Event was prob. zero, given models - but models still seen as largely ok ???
kocherlakota009	722062304087556096	2016-04-18T14:00:43	dandolfa if change is needed, it won't come from me.  It has to come from the new Lucas/Sargent/Prescott - they were all under 40 in 1975.
kocherlakota009	722061334389661696	2016-04-18T13:56:52	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio But my slides do deliver that (non N-F) result.  So: models on both sides.
kocherlakota009	722059132963053569	2016-04-18T13:48:07	dandolfa I haven't seen the empirical apps. of these frameworks that generate 20% unemployment in Greece for 8 or more years - have u?
kocherlakota009	722052224977870848	2016-04-18T13:20:40	tyillc lots of work on "what caused the crisis" - but little change in models is seen as needed to capture slow "recovery".
kocherlakota009	722046971217899520	2016-04-18T12:59:47	dandolfa no urgency among acads (especially &lt; 10 yrs out) to overhaul models to understand past 10 yrs (and next 10 yrs) of global econ.
kocherlakota009	722036898462593025	2016-04-18T12:19:46	Must-read last para of this Warsh post - acad. response to curr. situation is very different from response in 1970s: 
kocherlakota009	721866899773079553	2016-04-18T01:04:15	farmerrf 1954swilliamson no - it need not be true.  SS may not be unique eqm.  See for example here: 
kocherlakota009	721865010612432896	2016-04-18T00:56:44	farmerrf 1954swilliamson need way to isolate dir of causation ... that's why simple time series plots are unrevealing.
kocherlakota009	721864455760580608	2016-04-18T00:54:32	farmerrf 1954swilliamson corr between R and exp pi is agreed - Q is dir of causation.  N-F believe raising R *causes* exp pi to move up.
kocherlakota009	721863053558616068	2016-04-18T00:48:58	farmerrf 1954swilliamson simple time series plots do not isolate expt of interest.
kocherlakota009	721804353762365440	2016-04-17T20:55:43	ToreEllingsen1 1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio I do worry that many acads allow theoretical aesthetics to drown out info from data.
kocherlakota009	721803185367748609	2016-04-17T20:51:04	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio focus on SS conflates LR and SR - need to separate them.
kocherlakota009	721802684160995328	2016-04-17T20:49:05	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio my analysis implies that the response of long-run exps is in fact what matters: see 
kocherlakota009	721783834279337985	2016-04-17T19:34:10	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio if u need 100 mg of med for a cure, and dr can only legally give  u 50 mg - should u abandon all med? 2/2
kocherlakota009	721783290198368256	2016-04-17T19:32:01	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio We should expect policy "failure* if policy is constrained.  1/2

kocherlakota009	721781409334083586	2016-04-17T19:24:32	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio of course not - but existence of conv. wisdom does mean u need compelling evidence ... 1/2
kocherlakota009	721780845137281026	2016-04-17T19:22:18	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio but there are models on both sides.  So then u need evidence - for me, that's also part of science.
kocherlakota009	721771892856745985	2016-04-17T18:46:43	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio and in my BFI NK model with indeterminacy, it's a situation where r_nat is low and/or pi_T is low.
kocherlakota009	721768857577332736	2016-04-17T18:34:40	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio and u need evidence even more, b/c u are trying to change conv. wisdom.
kocherlakota009	721768405704056833	2016-04-17T18:32:52	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio and wp 22009 provides a model.  But - actually - we both need evidence, not models.
kocherlakota009	721754891920797701	2016-04-17T17:39:10	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio see NBER wp 22009 for quant-theoretical illustration of very persistent low pi at ELB.
kocherlakota009	721753972986494976	2016-04-17T17:35:31	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio or exp. persistent low AD plus ELB implies low expected pi .. comovement of endog. vars. is not compelling.
kocherlakota009	721746335993622528	2016-04-17T17:05:10	1954swilliamson FrancoisGourio you can look at mkt-based prob. dist. of fed funds futures (see Campbell et al NBER MacroAnnual).
kocherlakota009	721743211769831424	2016-04-17T16:52:45	kocherlakota009 1954swilliamson ...but if anything you see MP tightening leads to lower exp inflation (5f5) so the conventional sign
kocherlakota009	721744073632165888	2016-04-17T16:56:11	kocherlakota009 .. And that's consistent with a lot of other high freq studies - fin markets seem to believe in std response not fisherian
kocherlakota009	721744790967185409	2016-04-17T16:59:02	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson completely agree that the debate should shift to this kind of (quasi-exp'tal) empirical analysis.  2/2
kocherlakota009	721744446279270400	2016-04-17T16:57:40	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson I see ...while certainly not definitive,  this is suggestive. Thanks for sharing ...  1/2
kocherlakota009	721740963891253248	2016-04-17T16:43:49	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson Neo-F is different - says, given fixed long-run r_nat, lower long-run R target lowers l-r exp pi.  3/3
kocherlakota009	721740451527725056	2016-04-17T16:41:47	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson Fed (privately) sees low pi pressures, lowers R but only partially offsets, and so hh's lowers exp pi. 2/3
kocherlakota009	721740126569816064	2016-04-17T16:40:30	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson anyways: everyone agrees that lowering R could lead households to expect lower future pi.  1/3
kocherlakota009	721739226103083008	2016-04-17T16:36:55	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson now I've lost track of the sign!  Is this supposed to be neo-F or not?
kocherlakota009	721738552489459714	2016-04-17T16:34:14	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson sure - higher pi pressures that are only partially offset by higher R.
kocherlakota009	721738111395438592	2016-04-17T16:32:29	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson so higher short-term R means higher 10 yr nom?  Couldn't it easily be persistence in r_nat?
kocherlakota009	721736592029851648	2016-04-17T16:26:27	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson Idea is that if Fed announces increase in LR R, not based on LR r, then LR expected pi should rise.
kocherlakota009	721736362769166336	2016-04-17T16:25:32	FrancoisGourio 1954swilliamson IMO: relevant exp't involves shocks to long-run larget R that can be isolated from movements in long-run r.
kocherlakota009	721734750482919427	2016-04-17T16:19:08	1954swilliamson I think we'll have to agree to disagree.  I don't see how one can make progress on this imp't Q without empirical evidence.
kocherlakota009	721421103592247296	2016-04-16T19:32:49	1954swilliamson Maybe this is how you could begin to build an emp. case for N-F ... showing that forecasts of long-run R help forecast pi?
kocherlakota009	721420249808183296	2016-04-16T19:29:25	1954swilliamson Sure - but they don't feel the need to put in long-run forecast of R (even as that has been falling steadily).
kocherlakota009	721418242821124096	2016-04-16T19:21:27	1954swilliamson as u know, nothing unconventional to mon. theorists about R being low for long or even neg.  (QE is very different issue.)
kocherlakota009	721417601453289472	2016-04-16T19:18:54	1954swilliamson up to u.  If you really want to convince: you need sharp emp. evidence.  Theory and time series plots won't do it.
kocherlakota009	721416246772834306	2016-04-16T19:13:31	1954swilliamson Many doubt effectiveness of unconv. policies.  Your claim is distinct: pi would be higher now if Fed had raised R faster.
kocherlakota009	721415422478852096	2016-04-16T19:10:14	1954swilliamson check out 2009 or 2010 Greenbook forecasts for pi - accurate without being neo-F.
kocherlakota009	721414612646817792	2016-04-16T19:07:01	1954swilliamson suggestion: can u find a professional (non-CB) pi forecaster who uses Neo-F modeling to predict pi better than CBs?
kocherlakota009	721413402082590720	2016-04-16T19:02:12	1954swilliamson but IMO: theory cannot settle this issue - it depends on *empirical* issue of how LR exp pi reacts to R moves.
kocherlakota009	721412238473609216	2016-04-16T18:57:35	1954swilliamson I think that empirical burden of proof (fairly or not) always falls on the unconventional.
kocherlakota009	721411011773865988	2016-04-16T18:52:43	1954swilliamson can't be active near ZLB.
kocherlakota009	721399158842728451	2016-04-16T18:05:37	1954swilliamson passive case represents what happens at ZLB - see fragility paper for precise analysis of lower bound.
kocherlakota009	721398848145526786	2016-04-16T18:04:22	ToreEllingsen1 1954swilliamson I agree that NF does require active fiscal policy.
kocherlakota009	721398114117152768	2016-04-16T18:01:27	1954swilliamson co-movement between R and expected pi doesn't settle causation Q.  Need cleaner expt in data to convince.
kocherlakota009	721397701796106240	2016-04-16T17:59:49	1954swilliamson I don't get it - but probably others will understand what you mean.
kocherlakota009	721391410885300228	2016-04-16T17:34:49	ToreEllingsen1 1954swilliamson in my model, fiscal policy is passive.
kocherlakota009	721391007775006720	2016-04-16T17:33:13	1954swilliamson to convince: neo-Fs need clear nat'l expt that an increase in l-r R target will increase long-run pi exps at least 1 for 1.
kocherlakota009	721386544486092801	2016-04-16T17:15:29	1954swilliamson little evidence on either side.  To be clear: Agreement that moving long-run pi target will move long-run R.
kocherlakota009	721386154629718018	2016-04-16T17:13:56	1954swilliamson but this is all largely irrelevant.  Key Q is empirical: if CB raise L-R target R, will L-R pi rise by at least 1 for 1?
kocherlakota009	721383518060851200	2016-04-16T17:03:28	1954swilliamson is this a question about the fragility paper?

kocherlakota009	704410943288115201	2016-02-29T21:00:30	1954swilliamson Noahpinion IvanWerning yes.

kocherlakota009	704406747222556672	2016-02-29T20:43:50	Noahpinion IvanWerning Right - but this isn't about sticky prices or durability.  It's about the standard Euler eq'n ... 1/2

kocherlakota009	702181004673470465	2016-02-23T17:19:32	georgepearkes IMO: he ignores key fact: how low real r and how low real wages are.  That's why I see more room for higher pot. growth.

kocherlakota009	699223421901783040	2016-02-15T13:27:09	Victory4Mation and that's why there's an exhaustive outside audit by KPMG - to ensure that's not true.
kocherlakota009	699223120528408576	2016-02-15T13:25:57	MacRoweNick I think PLT is imp't but distinct issue - Kohn/Wessel focused on accountability in flex inf targeting regime.
kocherlakota009	699219911516758016	2016-02-15T13:13:12	Victory4Mation someone other than KPMG (current auditors)?
kocherlakota009	699219591768252416	2016-02-15T13:11:56	MacRoweNick But do you think Congress/public want upward pi misses (like 04-06) to be corrected through follow-on negative output gaps?
kocherlakota009	699214172303790080	2016-02-15T12:50:24	Missed this imp't piece: especially like quarterly, smaller numbers of reps/sens, and outside mon. pol. reviews. 
kocherlakota009	698999078924001281	2016-02-14T22:35:41	PIrelandatBC agreed - but IMO an output gap of that falls to -4% over 2 qtrs much more likely to be called "recession" now than in 60s.
kocherlakota009	698996074401415168	2016-02-14T22:23:45	PIrelandatBC then the same (relatively high) spread signals a fall of -2% - but we now call that a recession b/c baseline growth is so low
kocherlakota009	698995799473184769	2016-02-14T22:22:39	PIrelandatBC It could be simpler ... suppose that the level of the spread conveys information about the *change* in the growth rate ...

kocherlakota009	698992782933958656	2016-02-14T22:10:40	PIrelandatBC agreed- but if potential is 2% or less ... isn't the word "recession" going to be misleading,compared to what it meant pre-07?
kocherlakota009	698990825603211265	2016-02-14T22:02:54	kocherlakota009 point of graph is simply: people alarmed by flattening yld curve - true but not as much as in the past before recessions.
kocherlakota009	698989722232844288	2016-02-14T21:58:31	kocherlakota009 point well taken. like you, i'm also quite hesitant to judge the stance of mp w/ reference to nominal rates alone ...
kocherlakota009	698989079057317888	2016-02-14T21:55:57	PIrelandatBC only that smaller shocks to growth rate will lead to recessions if potential is lower.
kocherlakota009	698988620074582016	2016-02-14T21:54:08	PIrelandatBC think it depends on theory of WHY a fall in the spread predicts recessions (is there a preferred one out there)?  My pt. is ..

kocherlakota009	698985828396171265	2016-02-14T21:43:02	PIrelandatBC Peter - when you use this kind of recession indicator, how do you incorporate a (possible) decline in potential growth?
kocherlakota009	698647165669941250	2016-02-13T23:17:19	ntbay agree that's possible ...

kocherlakota009	698486669914284032	2016-02-13T12:39:34	florincitu 2 my point was that Fed was able to use its tools (like QE2) to get what it wanted.  But why didn't it want to achieve more?

kocherlakota009	698478321701507072	2016-02-13T12:06:23	florincitu not sure what you're saying ... I use ind. data in SEP to find FOMC's 3 yr objective. This was much lower than (long-run) 2%.
kocherlakota009	698286103103741954	2016-02-12T23:22:35	PabloBoza intended to make this happen (especially with QE2).
kocherlakota009	698285932869521408	2016-02-12T23:21:54	PabloBoza growth was much slower than FOMC anticipated - but inflation outcomes are still close to what they wanted.  And FOMC made moves .

kocherlakota009	694843780424425472	2016-02-03T11:24:01	BirdMgmt but all actions have risks .... we have the bens vs costs.  I see negative r as potentially useful given macro situation ...

kocherlakota009	694569695035392000	2016-02-02T17:14:54	BirdMgmt may be some of this ... but shouldn't this be fixed by better sup and reg (including by Fed) instead of too tight mon. pol.?
kocherlakota009	694569020431929344	2016-02-02T17:12:13	BirdMgmt we need more entry - more expected agg. demand would help stimulate that.
kocherlakota009	694568798565896192	2016-02-02T17:11:20	BirdMgmt good Qs ... Instability is not inevitable - but we need good policy choices now and later to mitigate this risk.
