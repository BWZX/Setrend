matthewstoller	684517204239384576	2016-01-05T23:29:53	shishiqiushi GrkStav ProfSteveKeen That's why I don't understand the Stiglitz critique. It was a critique about his choice of semantics!
matthewstoller	684511245039321088	2016-01-05T23:06:13	GrkStav ProfSteveKeen Intermediation happens somewhere. You have to give an alt process.
matthewstoller	684511183412400129	2016-01-05T23:05:58	GrkStav ProfSteveKeen Here you go: "How does surplus from labor/capital production get 'intermediated' into new capital production?"
matthewstoller	684510859574390785	2016-01-05T23:04:41	GrkStav ProfSteveKeen ProfessorWerner It's probably not.
matthewstoller	684509508341600256	2016-01-05T22:59:19	AuburnParks ProfessorWerner ProfSteveKeen Doesn't change the fact that Peru has to get dollars from somewhere.
matthewstoller	684509213855354881	2016-01-05T22:58:08	ProfSteveKeen Come on. This is a repeat game.
matthewstoller	684509036515999744	2016-01-05T22:57:26	GrkStav ProfSteveKeen ProfessorWerner I don't know what that means. I read a lot of Minsky and I've read Keen and Werner.
matthewstoller	684507715721232385	2016-01-05T22:52:11	GrkStav ProfSteveKeen I'm trying to avoid using savings = investment by saying surplus.
matthewstoller	684507439123705858	2016-01-05T22:51:05	GrkStav ProfSteveKeen ProfessorWerner This is like pulling teeth. I want to believe you guys but you refuse to explain your ideas.
matthewstoller	684507105240285184	2016-01-05T22:49:46	GrkStav ProfSteveKeen I'm using Minsky's definitions.
matthewstoller	684506177632260097	2016-01-05T22:46:04	ProfSteveKeen Also, you use a lot of shorthand, which is very confusing.
matthewstoller	684506023172767744	2016-01-05T22:45:28	ProfSteveKeen professorwerner Poor countries need to buy capital goods from rich countries, aka need dollars not just dom money creation.
matthewstoller	684505341636132864	2016-01-05T22:42:45	ProfSteveKeen Please explain.
matthewstoller	684495420697886720	2016-01-05T22:03:20	ProfSteveKeen How does surplus from labor/capital production get 'intermediated' into new capital production?
matthewstoller	684494875224489984	2016-01-05T22:01:10	GrkStav RichardJMurphy ProfSteveKeen That happens through the banking system.
matthewstoller	684494807696183296	2016-01-05T22:00:54	GrkStav RichardJMurphy ProfSteveKeen Some surplus from labor/capital asset production intermediated into new capital asset production.
matthewstoller	684494491953184768	2016-01-05T21:59:38	GrkStav RichardJMurphy ProfSteveKeen Presumably it's system wide, and intermediation happens in interbank market.
matthewstoller	684494359819976704	2016-01-05T21:59:07	ProfessorWerner ProfSteveKeen Where's Minsky on this?
matthewstoller	684494271425073152	2016-01-05T21:58:46	ProfessorWerner ProfSteveKeen Interesting, thanks. That capital inflow to rich countries was always a big unexplained 'puzzle'.
matthewstoller	684490206720860160	2016-01-05T21:42:37	ProfessorWerner ProfSteveKeen This is a good paper. Where was Minsky on this?
matthewstoller	684490108532162561	2016-01-05T21:42:13	ProfessorWerner ProfSteveKeen That does not necessarily follow. Banks in, say, Peru cannot credibly create, say, dollars to buy US inputs.
