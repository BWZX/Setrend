greggutfeld	708476616545009664	2016-03-12T02:16:02	amazing how protestors don't want to express themselves when asked why they are there.
greggutfeld	708476358226288645	2016-03-12T02:15:01	lets not forget: the left shut down what they have no answer for.

greggutfeld	708471470545047552	2016-03-12T01:55:35	the leftist intolerance of such speech will only make that speech louder and more volatile. it's pretty much on them.

greggutfeld	708468715587833856	2016-03-12T01:44:39	to admire protestors for shutting down a rally, and describe them as peaceful afterward, is cowardice.

greggutfeld	688913399208652801	2016-01-18T02:38:48	this debate is the opposite of a thing you would watch for fun.

greggutfeld	688912353300209664	2016-01-18T02:34:39	will someone let martin talk?
greggutfeld	688912202003255300	2016-01-18T02:34:02	the democratic party can be summed up from this debate: things that other people cost money, and that's wrong.
greggutfeld	688911901481369600	2016-01-18T02:32:51	this is so boring that the crowd erupts when bernie says, "hillary didn't answer the question."
greggutfeld	688910934539153408	2016-01-18T02:29:00	this is the weakest bunch of candidates since Tracey Flick ran against Paul Metzler.
greggutfeld	688910092712960000	2016-01-18T02:25:40	HRC is demanding that cops prevent overdoses. But I thought it was the cops who were the problem.
greggutfeld	688909652306845696	2016-01-18T02:23:55	Bernie should visit NYC. his suggestions are already implemented.
greggutfeld	688909531909345280	2016-01-18T02:23:26	Bernie, at least, sounds like he means it.

greggutfeld	688908281843167232	2016-01-18T02:18:28	Violent crime has been cut in half in two decades, yet they say the justice system is broken.
greggutfeld	688907986069274624	2016-01-18T02:17:17	HRC has no ideas. Which is why she speaks in a halting, lost fashion.
greggutfeld	688907675661389825	2016-01-18T02:16:03	Martin rehearsed this. and it's painful.
greggutfeld	688907324501667840	2016-01-18T02:14:40	If you want to push a false idea, conflate all incidents as one. Which is exactly what HRC did with guns.
greggutfeld	688907020825669632	2016-01-18T02:13:27	i love the idea of a mom and pop gun shop.  Here's your chocolate malt, and a Smith and Wesson
greggutfeld	688906284104572928	2016-01-18T02:10:32	I believe Martin O'Malley works out in a full body lycra unitard
greggutfeld	688905975441584128	2016-01-18T02:09:18	HRC is talking about unity -  After pushing division like a pilled up math instructor.
greggutfeld	688905493104996354	2016-01-18T02:07:23	Martin should be doing Viagra commercials, driving down the road in a 67 Mustang, listening to Steppenwolf.
greggutfeld	688905005928173568	2016-01-18T02:05:27	Hillary remembers so many things that place her in extraordinary places at unusual times.
