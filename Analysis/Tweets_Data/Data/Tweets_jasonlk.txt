jasonlk	697470409571069956	2016-02-10T17:21:18	Good morning from SaaStrAnnual In SF. In case you're wondering, it's a saas conference and not a music concert. 
jasonlk	449624581033439232	2014-03-28T19:10:28	Just. Wow. If you're into SaaS or internet startups check out this phenomenal AMA by jasonlk 
jasonlk	710300462872797185	2016-03-17T03:03:21	Need huge ROI on initiatives that come out of mgmt fees vs. portfolio co. $$$.   Like 10x force multiplier.
jasonlk	710300298581901313	2016-03-17T03:02:42	True platforms in VC are very hard to build because you spend management fees.  Much better to get portfolio cos. to spend the $$$.
jasonlk	710298995151609856	2016-03-17T02:57:31	So ... if you think you can't compete with Sequoia, you are missing the point.  There are micro-platforms in every micro-segment of VC.
jasonlk	710298689013592064	2016-03-17T02:56:18	So ... if you don't show up to YC b/c it's "picked over" you are missing the point.
jasonlk	710298265019781120	2016-03-17T02:54:37	Around '05, the age of The Series A Picker in VC ended in B2C.  It ended around '09 in SaaS and B2B.  Where founders had to pitch everyone.
jasonlk	710297209896472576	2016-03-17T02:50:26	"Proprietary dealflow" is even worse than dealflow.  It means, absent YC, that you have nothing.
jasonlk	710296982712033280	2016-03-17T02:49:32	Platforms don't create dealflow.    Dealflow is for suckers.  Platforms get you picked.  That's how you do 5-6x+.
jasonlk	710296825241022464	2016-03-17T02:48:54	9/10 VCs that think they have a platform.  Don't.
jasonlk	710296449121013760	2016-03-17T02:47:24	The VC platforms are very different at different stage.    Pick a platform that doesn't match your stage = wasted opportunity.

jasonlk	701086380235972608	2016-02-20T16:49:53	ViableBen rabois that's where you start to get into trouble.  an insane projection pre-revenue and pre-customer is OK :)

jasonlk	701084949454069760	2016-02-20T16:44:12	ViableBen rabois for me, always absent a large externality.  founders are actually conservative deep down.
jasonlk	701084794814246912	2016-02-20T16:43:35	ViableBen the real problem with insane projections are when they don't really tie to the trailing 3-4 months.
jasonlk	701084550760239104	2016-02-20T16:42:37	If u don't know what to do, 1st invest in Customer Success. Always works. Then invest more in QA. Sort of same thing 
jasonlk	701084138728615936	2016-02-20T16:40:58	rabois problem with 50% IMHO is it doesn't have accountability associated with it.  Could Happen.  Might Not.
jasonlk	701084022277935104	2016-02-20T16:40:31	rabois 30% i can "feel".  90% is "in the bag", but with some risk.  trailing growth with few good hires.  60% more onus on founder than 50%
jasonlk	701083667016200192	2016-02-20T16:39:06	rabois if i say build me 3 variants -- 30% / 60% / 90% confidence any founder can do this.  just 50% somehow harder.
jasonlk	701083519766802433	2016-02-20T16:38:31	rabois y.  i've found C-30/C-60/C-90 have a Fibonacci-esque element to them that make them easier to grok than 50%
jasonlk	701083081826897920	2016-02-20T16:36:46	VCs and funders will take your projections seriously, even if they haircut them. Present a C-30 plan at most (30% confidence). C-60 ideally
jasonlk	701082767791009792	2016-02-20T16:35:31	semil yes.  but you can't manage truly insane projections.  not for too long.
jasonlk	701082370112229377	2016-02-20T16:33:57	Providing insane projections to funders never ends well.  And everyone to blame in this case.
