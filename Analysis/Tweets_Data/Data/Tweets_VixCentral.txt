VixCentral	691646005297729536	2016-01-25T15:37:12	It is indeed perplexing. Would be happy to hear ideas on this. Also on why VXV is not in sync with the futures. 
VixCentral	691640254252609536	2016-01-25T15:14:21	schaeffers agwarner Also perplexed as to why the indices are so much higher than the futures. Any ideas?

VixCentral	690640656017051648	2016-01-22T21:02:18	ian760105 Not necessarily, It is more related to the cost of rolling the mid-term futures vs. the near term futures, VXX vs VXZ

VixCentral	689563425438064641	2016-01-19T21:41:46	RalphJLindblom You are right about tomorrow. I frequently highlight the fact that contango tends to jump at expiration.

VixCentral	689464022580748288	2016-01-19T15:06:47	I agree, there is no panic. Unfortunately, investors in volatility need to be worried all the time.

VixCentral	688754097604943873	2016-01-17T16:05:47	Great overview. When I talk about "backwardation" I mean that the second month VIX future is higher than the first.

VixCentral	687748182718177281	2016-01-14T21:28:39	GEQSense It is like holding any option that loses value with time. Investors look for the cheapest way to hedge and sometimes UVXY fits

VixCentral	687738118615764992	2016-01-14T20:48:39	My two favorite indicators for "all clear" are: 1) VVIX around 80  2) No backwardation We are quite far yet

VixCentral	687502878982930433	2016-01-14T05:13:54	jcvictory The whole term structure moved up a lot, not just the front month and that mitigated the backwardation.
