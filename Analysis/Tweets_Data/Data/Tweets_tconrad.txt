tconrad	685839435414413312	2016-01-09T15:03:58	MikeIsaac do you mean "help." or "help?"
tconrad	685836547946512384	2016-01-09T14:52:29	MikeIsaac pretty sure the first rule of hackathons is the opposite of the first rule of fight club.

tconrad	685146656698810368	2016-01-07T17:11:07	MikeIsaac it's not at all obvious to me that "sure" is fine but if I say "sure." I'm subtly being a dick.
tconrad	685146436254629888	2016-01-07T17:10:14	MikeIsaac I find the thread recently about the use of periods at the end of sentences while texting to be aggressive really fascinating.

tconrad	685145648945971200	2016-01-07T17:07:06	MikeIsaac wait why is this annoying? I hate the 500 word email that boils down to "ok" much more.

tconrad	684964465750573056	2016-01-07T05:07:09	drwave mgsiegler I'd settle for an esc key and fixing blatant keyboard bugs (for example try cmd-tab fast to switch apps - super buggy)
tconrad	684963816841416704	2016-01-07T05:04:34	mgsiegler drwave the trick is where the keyboard ends up 
tconrad	684963434933293056	2016-01-07T05:03:03	drwave mgsiegler it supports it's weight that way but I don't think you'd want to draw on it.

tconrad	684065987914633216	2016-01-04T17:36:55	reckless yeah they started licensing the other side maybe 8 months ago? Some game controllers and headphones use it.

tconrad	683839731180818435	2016-01-04T02:37:51	iPad Pro flaw: there are almost no scenarios where portrait orientation makes sense, but front facing camera is placed at "top" of portrait
