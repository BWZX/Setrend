WeiDuCNA	723065379975626752	2016-04-21T08:26:35	CYLeung insists he didn't know who threw the glass until police made the arrest, thus never targeted Wong. Wong calls that incredible.

WeiDuCNA	723064601709940736	2016-04-21T08:23:29	Wong now says Leung only pressed charge because of their bad blood in LegCo. CYLeung denies.

WeiDuCNA	723054191569051648	2016-04-21T07:42:07	Now Wong has moved on to discuss different sounds a glass would make hitting the floor and a wooden panel. Gripping stuff.
WeiDuCNA	723050662913658880	2016-04-21T07:28:06	Wong seems to be arguing that the glass he threw posed no real danger. But then even the judge is confused by his line of questioning.
WeiDuCNA	723049205887954944	2016-04-21T07:22:18	CY says it was sheer luck that the glass Wong threw didn't hurt him. Wong got fired up, saying he didn't ask CY about that.

WeiDuCNA	722998052143796225	2016-04-21T03:59:02	Wong now says Leung never gave statement to police but colluded with police to come up with a story. Leung disagrees.
WeiDuCNA	722997186187780096	2016-04-21T03:55:36	Judge intervenes to ask Wong exactly where his questioning is headed as Wong dwells on names and ranks of officers who took CY's statement.
WeiDuCNA	722996429245939712	2016-04-21T03:52:36	CY now visibly amused by Wong's questioning.
WeiDuCNA	722990829065768961	2016-04-21T03:30:20	Wong tells judge HK leader CY Leung has "lost control." Judge asks Wong to refrain from providing commentary. comedy
WeiDuCNA	722990316626661377	2016-04-21T03:28:18	Leung now says he no longer wishes to answer repetitive questions from Wong.
WeiDuCNA	722989203450003456	2016-04-21T03:23:53	Wong says Leung's statement to police was drafted by officers. Leung disagrees.
WeiDuCNA	722986974412296198	2016-04-21T03:15:01	"Witness is lying AS USUAL," Wong says about HK leader CY Leung. CY objects to that characterization.
WeiDuCNA	722986384642826244	2016-04-21T03:12:41	Wong says Leung's statement to police unspecific, which amounts to lying.
WeiDuCNA	722986150252531713	2016-04-21T03:11:45	Leung says many legislators throw things at him with different force, might be why his choice of words changed.
WeiDuCNA	722984912236646400	2016-04-21T03:06:50	CY repeatedly says 抛掷碇 all mean the same thing. I'm struggling to see how this is relevant.

WeiDuCNA	722983755061719041	2016-04-21T03:02:14	Wong shows Leung video of his speech after the glass throwing incident, asks if Leung made the speech himself. Judge confused.
WeiDuCNA	722982108394737664	2016-04-21T02:55:41	Judge warns audience not to get overexcited as CY Leung is called.
WeiDuCNA	722978709746012160	2016-04-21T02:42:11	Judge rules the number of officers who took CYLeung's statement doesn't matter, rejects Wong's request to adjourn trial.
WeiDuCNA	722973992408084480	2016-04-21T02:23:26	Wolf_InTheWilds he did say in that interview he wanted to chug a glass of water at Leung but accidentally threw the glass.
WeiDuCNA	722972066526285825	2016-04-21T02:15:47	Wong repeated says he's "sacred" cuz prosecution isn't upfront with him. Not sure if he wants to portray the trial as political prosecution.
