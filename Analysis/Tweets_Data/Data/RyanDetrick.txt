RyanDetrick	713101350415036417	2016-03-24T20:33:05	Out of the first 5 days in '16, the SPX dropped 1.5%, 1.3%, 2.4% and 1.1%.  Had a 0.2% gain in there also.
RyanDetrick	713099102641393664	2016-03-24T20:24:09	MarchMadness?  SPX has moved 1% (up or down) only 3 days this month. Would be the least since last June.  11, 13, and 10 the past 3 months.
RyanDetrick	713097305197555712	2016-03-24T20:17:00	SPX weekly win streak is over at 5, with a 0.7% drop this week  - meaning the record 13 straight in '57 is safe!
RyanDetrick	713096777273057281	2016-03-24T20:14:55	SPX down 0.7% last year and down 0.4% right now (excluding divs).  Sure feels like a lot more has happened :)

RyanDetrick	711944115257106436	2016-03-21T15:54:39	Our quick thoughts on today's market... 
RyanDetrick	711905907685367808	2016-03-21T13:22:49	So five of the past six times the SPX was up 5 weeks in a row, it was up the sixth week.  It closed higher for the 5th straight week on Fri.
RyanDetrick	711904949010096128	2016-03-21T13:19:01	The SPX hasn't closed up or down 1% for five straight days. This is the longest streak so far in 2016. Remember, 26 of first 50 days it did.

RyanDetrick	711752315615748097	2016-03-21T03:12:30	_BurtWhite Ha, no. Did drop my phone yesterday and shattered the glass. Figured one broken thing was good for the weekend.
RyanDetrick	711749392559185920	2016-03-21T03:00:53	_BurtWhite But it showed the boys how heartbreaking Ohio teams can be. Glad we are moving!
RyanDetrick	711749069652230144	2016-03-21T02:59:36	_BurtWhite Will never understand why teams don't foul when up 3. Wisc needed a FT, offensive board, and score. Way harder than one 3.

RyanDetrick	711557874770649090	2016-03-20T14:19:52	Since '28, SPX up &gt;1% for 5 straight weeks 16 other times.  Higher 4-wks later 13 of 16 times.
RyanDetrick	711557454987960320	2016-03-20T14:18:12	This is interesting. Past 30 yrs, SPX up &gt;1% 5 straight weeks 5 other times.  The avg return 4-wks later is +3.8% and higher all 5 times.
RyanDetrick	711555869562028034	2016-03-20T14:11:54	So five of the past six times the SPX was up 5 weeks in a row, it was up the sixth week.

RyanDetrick	711175319084994560	2016-03-19T12:59:43	Is the SPX or emerging markets more correlated with crude?  Would you believe the SPX?  LPLResearch takes a look 
RyanDetrick	711173672992706560	2016-03-19T12:53:11	Largest quarterly gain ever was 86.5% in 2Q '33. The worst? -39.4% in 2Q  '32. To put in perspective, 4Q '08 down 22.6% and 2Q '09 up 15.2%.
RyanDetrick	711172119250522113	2016-03-19T12:47:00	This quarter the SPX was down more &gt;10% at lows and is now up for the quarter.  The only other time that has ever happened was 4Q '33.  Wow.

RyanDetrick	710923043233779712	2016-03-18T20:17:16	SPX is now 3.81% off its all-time high.  Seems like yesterday it was 14.16% on 2/11/16.  That kicked off the 3 consecutive days of &gt;1.6%.
RyanDetrick	710920822156873728	2016-03-18T20:08:26	SPX up &gt;1% for 5 straight wks.  Hit 6 off the March '09 lows. Have to go back to '62 for the time before that.  Record is 8 in a row in '32.
RyanDetrick	710919779230597120	2016-03-18T20:04:18	2 wks ago McClellan Oscillator closed &gt;100.  Was widely considered 'super overbought' at the time.  Past 2 wks SPX up 1.1% and 1.4%. Whoops.
RyanDetrick	710918445525831680	2016-03-18T19:59:00	'16 officially was down &gt;10% YTD at lows and is now green.  Should SPX finish yr green, it would be only the 5th yr since WWII to do that.
RyanDetrick	710916603605426176	2016-03-18T19:51:41	Longest ever to start a yr w all negative YTD days (not counting if the full yr was negative) was '57 with the first 91 days negative YTD.
RyanDetrick	710915886870372352	2016-03-18T19:48:50	So '62, '77, and '08 will remain the only years to never have one day of the entire yr positive YTD.  MarchMadness
RyanDetrick	710915278838878213	2016-03-18T19:46:25	The longest streak ever of negative YTD days for SPX?  329 straight days.  All of '77 was negative YTD, then '78 was negative until 4/24/78.
RyanDetrick	710914715510317059	2016-03-18T19:44:10	SPX about to close green for the first time this year.  Took 52 days.  Longest since '08 went 253 days (full yr) without a positive YTD day.

RyanDetrick	704804534833520641	2016-03-01T23:04:30	One day thing?  Or something more? 
RyanDetrick	704802890242789376	2016-03-01T22:57:58	Since '60, SPX gained &gt;2% on 1st day of mo 26 other times. Rest of mo? Up 0.96% on avg and 1.94% median. Higher 65% of the time.
RyanDetrick	704801843403218945	2016-03-01T22:53:48	What happens when 1st day of mo gains &gt;2%? Past 3 times (Jan '13, Dec '10, and Sept '10), the SPX gained 2.4%, 4.3%, and 5.6% rest of month.
RyanDetrick	704800893431115776	2016-03-01T22:50:02	SPX closed at the high tick for the day, also gained &gt;2%.  Second time this year, the other was Jan 29.
RyanDetrick	704798036996853764	2016-03-01T22:38:41	SPX up 1.56% for the week. If it gains more than 1%, will be 3 straight weeks above 1%.  21 months since that last happened.

RyanDetrick	704373348437008385	2016-02-29T18:31:07	Think about this. If the SPX is green today, the last day of the month will be up twice in 2016.  It was up only twice all of last year.

RyanDetrick	704337464341696513	2016-02-29T16:08:32	Should SPX in Feb finish green it will be one of 8 mos since 1970 to be down &gt;6% at the lows and close green. 3 mo later median return 9.3%.

RyanDetrick	704316954014785537	2016-02-29T14:47:02	Horrible Chi Area PMI in Feb, but remember, this is a very volatile series. Was 47.6 vs est of 52.5, Jan was 55.6. Jan/Feb avg of 51.6 is ok

RyanDetrick	703327667370795010	2016-02-26T21:15:57	SPX missed out on back to back 2% weekly gains, but was still up 4.47% the past two weeks. The best 2-week return in more than a year.
RyanDetrick	703326435319128064	2016-02-26T21:11:04	Since '90, 7 months down 6% at one pt and finished green.  Feb could be the 8th.  3 months later the SPX sported a 9.3% median return btw.
RyanDetrick	703325622714703873	2016-02-26T21:07:50	SPX still barely positive for the month at 0.4%. Remember hasn't been lower 3 mo in row for 54 mos. It all comes down to leap day. LeapYear
RyanDetrick	703324513816203264	2016-02-26T21:03:25	SPX lower and crude lower today.  As we showed earlier this week, 2016 is the most correlated they've ever been.

RyanDetrick	703206275258130434	2016-02-26T13:13:35	We noted yesterday on the LPLResearch blog why 1950 was a big level for the SPX.  Above it now, can it stick?  
RyanDetrick	703205891705851905	2016-02-26T13:12:04	SPX with a shot at back to back weekly 2% gains.  That hasn't happen in over a year.  Also, February with a chance at 7 consecutive wins.
RyanDetrick	703078991448551426	2016-02-26T04:47:48	Looking at the "decision box" that currently frames the SP500, we examine what technicals say about the next move... 
RyanDetrick	702996183426461696	2016-02-25T23:18:45	This happened right after AAII bulls came in near their lowest level in 23 years. Funny how it works.  
RyanDetrick	702995694165094400	2016-02-25T23:16:49	SPX up 1.77% for the week. Has a shot at back to back 2% weekly gains for the first  time in a yr.
RyanDetrick	702995380477239296	2016-02-25T23:15:34	10 of the past 13 times the SPX gained &gt;2.5% for the week it was green the following week. Looking like might go 11 for 14.
RyanDetrick	702981992569241604	2016-02-25T22:22:22	Today on the LPLResearch blog we look at one potential bullish pattern forming on the SPX.  
RyanDetrick	702980674521800704	2016-02-25T22:17:08	SPX under 50-day MA first 36 days to start the year. This is the 5th longest streak to ever start a yr. '82, '69, '08, and '70 were longer.
RyanDetrick	702974778299293696	2016-02-25T21:53:42	38 days beneath 50-day MA for SPX was the 71st longest streak ever.
RyanDetrick	702972502226706432	2016-02-25T21:44:39	SPX closed above 50-day MA for the first time in 38 days. That was the longest below since late '11. Longest ever was 97 days in '46.
RyanDetrick	702970429967880195	2016-02-25T21:36:25	_BurtWhite LPLResearch Well, I could use an idea for tomorrow. Gives the weekend for everyone to get ready for the big day also.  Like it!

RyanDetrick	702968374100434944	2016-02-25T21:28:15	_BurtWhite Interesting that it will come down to the extra day we get in February due to Leap Year.
