sama	722864743380180992	2016-04-20T19:09:19	"The S&amp;P is within 1% of its all time high and seed investors keep telling me that equity markets have collapsed and deals are repricing."
sama	722589178492428289	2016-04-20T00:54:19	The ability of a field to accept a contribution from an outsider seems to be very indicative of its ability to make progress.
sama	721493354450563072	2016-04-17T00:19:55	An article on YC from 2008: 
sama	720679859169714178	2016-04-14T18:27:22	Trains are my favorite place to work.
sama	720658420219658240	2016-04-14T17:02:11	A related and very common question we run into from founders outside of SV is if they have to pay back the money if they fail.
sama	720658185749721090	2016-04-14T17:01:15	Lesson: Don't assume people know how YC works.  Startups are still not well-understood by almost all of the world.
sama	720657967008366592	2016-04-14T17:00:23	Question of the day: "Does your program offer scholarships for low-income founders?"
sama	720639334421000192	2016-04-14T15:46:20	With genome editing and AI, we will be the first species ever to design our own descendants.  Crazy thought.
sama	720619421107163136	2016-04-14T14:27:13	That comment aside, I was incredibly impressed by MIT.  They always manage to get/train incredible engineering students.
sama	720613807861719040	2016-04-14T14:04:54	Me: "Really?  Why?" Students: "Because it's the hardest job to get and everybody else wants it.  Oh and you can make a lot of money fast."
sama	720613360908267521	2016-04-14T14:03:08	Me: "Where do MIT CS students most want to go after college?  Facebook?  Google? Their own startup?" Students: "Jane Street"

sama	715682055724474369	2016-03-31T23:27:53	We break up YC into smaller subsets, so you get to work with a few partners closely but still have the benefits of a large network.
sama	715681862652289025	2016-03-31T23:27:07	Saying smaller programs are better than YC is like saying a tiny college is better than Stanford--true for some people, but not most.

sama	714518855305957376	2016-03-28T18:25:44	1) they cut R+D spending, 2) try to spend less paying workers and 3) generally try to do things to help short-term earnings
sama	714518755586408448	2016-03-28T18:25:21	If you tie CEO comp to share price, and CEOs expect to be at a company for ~3 years, then you should not be surprised when:
sama	714312051871494144	2016-03-28T04:43:59	Best companies either set their valuation to something reasonable, or say "no" when investors say "I need it for my brand value".
sama	714311773663309825	2016-03-28T04:42:52	(Don't entirely agree with this, but it is generally true that the best YC companies don't hand out advisor shares to investors.)
sama	714311568750563328	2016-03-28T04:42:03	"You don't want advisor shares in any company that will agree to give them to you as part of your investment."

sama	709519955323006977	2016-03-14T23:21:54	6/ So you should always be willing to go back to investors with more progress and data, though at some point you won't need them!
sama	709519790193254400	2016-03-14T23:21:14	5/ Also, "this doesn't fit my investment criteria" usually means "I don't see this being a billion dollar company".
sama	709518792787759104	2016-03-14T23:17:17	4/ And best of all: "Which companies have you invested in that no one else seemed excited about?"
sama	709518668946808832	2016-03-14T23:16:47	3/ Instead, ask investor: "Which of your recent investments are you most excited about? Which companies do you wish you'd invested in?"
sama	709518302574325760	2016-03-14T23:15:20	2/ These are (obviously) not helpful for figuring out which investors to target.
sama	709518175377817601	2016-03-14T23:14:49	1/ Almost all seed investors give ~identical lists of what they're interested in--"I'm interested in SaaS, VR, IoT, and consumer mobile".

sama	692875995011899394	2016-01-29T01:04:44	The kind of business development a startup should be doing is called "sales". IE, get someone to give you money for your product.
sama	692873665776472065	2016-01-29T00:55:29	It's incredibly distracting, you have little control over what the other company does or doesn't do, and new startups have little leverage.
