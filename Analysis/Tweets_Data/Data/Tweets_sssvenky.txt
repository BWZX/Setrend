sssvenky	723251663268532224	2016-04-21T20:46:48	So have a few short 725 puts, will exercise some and cover some. Bought some stock - had an order at 725/727.

sssvenky	723237306014949377	2016-04-21T19:49:45	Agree with that part. Not totally convinced.  
sssvenky	723237011880976384	2016-04-21T19:48:35	So SPY - evening * confirmation to 8 SMA. Let it get to 21 SMA for me to cry about. Trade both ways, make money.

sssvenky	723236264703463424	2016-04-21T19:45:37	That means that there cannot be a super sustained move higher unless ER blows out of the roof.
sssvenky	723236170075795456	2016-04-21T19:45:14	I went long GOOGL in a bullish way with protection underneath but that OI I see for next 2 weeks, I don't like them. No put support above.

sssvenky	723187099579502593	2016-04-21T16:30:15	Have to ask one question though. Is the market open? Nothing moving on my screen.
sssvenky	723186875393953793	2016-04-21T16:29:21	Quiet time now... Working on few options for GOOGL. Not seeing any messages.

sssvenky	723186266058067970	2016-04-21T16:26:56	Robs1111 haha! I meant longs and shorts.
sssvenky	723186055260725248	2016-04-21T16:26:06	I don't think that QQQ ever filled that gap. Hmm!! Watching closely for a rotation into this at some point. NQ_F
sssvenky	723185848653500418	2016-04-21T16:25:17	Robs1111 Doesn't mean I have no shorts in my bag.

sssvenky	723174172248014848	2016-04-21T15:38:53	Seeing a combo trade or two in GOOGL but not sure which leg was sold. Not much time to research either. 
sssvenky	723168178377891841	2016-04-21T15:15:04	And if that 2095 doesn't hold or gets retaken, potential to lose 2090 is bigger on ES_F and chances to get to 2085/2082 zone. Baby steps.
sssvenky	723164822737559555	2016-04-21T15:01:44	ES_F if 2095 does hold like it has, 2100 retest with a chance to 2105-06 zone. Over that 2110 potential.

sssvenky	719688737349898241	2016-04-12T00:49:00	Decided not to post ES_F, SPY charts. 3-4 different views if you were the so call bear or bull. I will get confused too.

sssvenky	712273402694766592	2016-03-22T13:43:07	SPY - Loss of 203 if it does will open the door for 201-200 zone (Open Interest). Will be a good reset too if need be.

sssvenky	711712582269165568	2016-03-21T00:34:37	Consolidation this week being holiday shortened week will be really good. Friday is a holiday as many have expressed.
sssvenky	711712392854446080	2016-03-21T00:33:52	So many hate the market. Sentiment is negative still. Too many calling for lower - might be a catalyst for higher.
sssvenky	711711705651224576	2016-03-21T00:31:08	Oh well. One more thing. SMH related names look decent. IBB may be. XLV - rotation around there - potential. Rotation the norm so far.
sssvenky	711711385789403136	2016-03-21T00:29:51	That said, have a wonderful evening. No futures trading in the night.
sssvenky	711711261264707584	2016-03-21T00:29:22	Rotation may be the norm. 6 out of 9 S&amp;P sectors are overbought (RSI says so). XLV is not. XLE &amp; XLE nearing but not yet. Setups there.
sssvenky	711710121265528834	2016-03-21T00:24:50	SPY Monthly cheatsheet - shows price over 21 MA. How we  close the month is important here on.

sssvenky	711708824441212928	2016-03-21T00:19:41	Some complacency seen = yes. But no clear sell signal yet. Wait for price action to confirm. Going short blindly is a fools game.
sssvenky	711708624670752768	2016-03-21T00:18:53	Pullback in SPY - 203 1st sup, then 201-200 zone as per OI. Tons of support lower via puts. 205 then 206 resistance. Clears sees 207-208 MM.
sssvenky	711708338724036609	2016-03-21T00:17:45	Let VIX first get over 17-18 zone, clear resistance then we shall see. Until then subdued VIX IMHO.
sssvenky	711708127289147392	2016-03-21T00:16:55	Looked at VIX along with the VIX:$VXV charts and the OI. Many pointing towards lower prices, even towards 200 or 198 in SPY.

sssvenky	711197621835186176	2016-03-19T14:28:21	Still see a ton of question whether I am bullish or bearish OR whether this is bull or bear market. I follow price. Rest is noise.
sssvenky	711197262542561281	2016-03-19T14:26:55	I will eventually play AAPL on the long side but only after seeing the reaction to the event next week. Looks better IMHO.
sssvenky	711197026394853376	2016-03-19T14:25:59	Seeing quite a few Inverted Head &amp; Shoulders breakout or breakout retests in progress. Interesting...

sssvenky	711048244575412224	2016-03-19T04:34:46	Kamada3 always breakout retest of breakout zone and if that holds then that's my buy. Chasing the breakout is dangerous IMHO.
sssvenky	711040612552744960	2016-03-19T04:04:27	Kamada3 well depends on the timeframe but mostly prefer consolidation.

sssvenky	705786415376764929	2016-03-04T16:06:08	Added a small chunk short to GC_F right here. Will add on the loss of the last lows.
sssvenky	705785224693583872	2016-03-04T16:01:25	If ES_F can get over 1997-98 zone and above 2001.25, then can see 2006-2011. Just saying. Levels I'm watching if higher.

sssvenky	705779133561712640	2016-03-04T15:37:12	A pull back to 8 SMA on daily timeframe in SPY will be very constructive now that 50 SMA is starting to flatten &amp; 21 SMA rising.

sssvenky	704418403147055105	2016-02-29T21:30:09	Out of all VRX positions - not sure if I posted an update. Looking to imitate a new long in GE if above 29.50.
sssvenky	704417858013437952	2016-02-29T21:27:59	No futures positions but looking to initiate position in $6J_F CL_F and GC_F (long or short will depend on parameters &amp; price).
sssvenky	704417600726388736	2016-02-29T21:26:58	Still holding a few COTY at a loss but collar helping. And that small UVXY - still holding but size is super small.
sssvenky	704417359369338881	2016-02-29T21:26:00	Wow! Meetings after meetings. Took profits in 1/2 CREE and adjusted collar a bit. MNST still short via 125 &amp; 120 March puts.
sssvenky	704416941486649345	2016-02-29T21:24:20	2/1/2016 = 2/29/2016

sssvenky	704398049255133184	2016-02-29T20:09:16	ES_F at potential support while CL_F didn't budge? Something different?
sssvenky	704391214447996929	2016-02-29T19:42:07	CL_F holding strong today.
sssvenky	704388861749628928	2016-02-29T19:32:46	Yen on watch tonight.
sssvenky	704388533897670656	2016-02-29T19:31:28	Every time you try to go long GC_F where there is a buy signal, it pukes. Looks okay chart wise but tricky. Neg divergences still there.
sssvenky	704386113402642437	2016-02-29T19:21:50	If 1940 gives way, potential retest zone to 1927-29 on ES_F. See if it holds there which I think it may.
sssvenky	704384807308906496	2016-02-29T19:16:39	Open Interest input for SPY from the blog. 
sssvenky	704373242933354496	2016-02-29T18:30:42	IBB Meh.. Looks like it wants 250-245.
sssvenky	704372957791985664	2016-02-29T18:29:34	Commented on StockTwits: you are better of playing futures. I got tired of those tighter ones. no edge. 
sssvenky	704368396935114753	2016-02-29T18:11:27	Market Makers may try to close SPY over the 50 MA line. Constructive and that monthly candle would look feisty. Just saying..
sssvenky	704363773910343680	2016-02-29T17:53:04	"OptionsHawk S&amp;P 500 SPY trading 136,000 June $194 puts today w/buyers $7.89 to $8.01, trading vs. 90K $184 puts sold and 46K $182 puts"
sssvenky	704362288384311296	2016-02-29T17:47:10	Unless day trading, I will be cautious a tad with NYMO at 86.25.
sssvenky	704354274059268096	2016-02-29T17:15:19	SJosephBurns Thank you for the opportunity and inclusion. Appreciate it. God bless.
sssvenky	704353778795851776	2016-02-29T17:13:21	canuck2usa Nicely put.
sssvenky	704353524566458372	2016-02-29T17:12:21	This alone will save you many headaches and $ lost
sssvenky	704344980987359232	2016-02-29T16:38:24	When trading dont get anxious to make a trade because of idea or a preconception ...Always wait for a signal...see the forest thru the trees
sssvenky	704353415598440448	2016-02-29T17:11:55	1 hr / 4 hr charts all look constructive. ES...
sssvenky	704350918418956288	2016-02-29T17:01:59	End of the month, how we close today is important. Monthly candle ofcourse. That said, will be back later towards close.
sssvenky	704350277327925248	2016-02-29T16:59:26	And stopped GC_F short at 1933 (entry 1936.5) - too small for comfort. Looks more perky than anything else - holding well despite -ve div.
