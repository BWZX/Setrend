MarketUrbanism	720344983987851264	2016-04-13T20:16:42	In Europe, transit governance is more local. It's more closely aligned with the people who actually use it.
MarketUrbanism	720344873249988609	2016-04-13T20:16:15	But both of these governance structures are similar in that states, not localities, are in control. Same with WMATA!

MarketUrbanism	718935952585072642	2016-04-09T22:57:42	samnoble I think $1,000 was an exaggeration. Another article from 1970 mentions $750-850 as the general high

MarketUrbanism	718530287404232704	2016-04-08T20:05:44	RWhelanWSJ Williamsbridge and Westchester Sq. actually did have that zoning until Bloomberg downzoned them
MarketUrbanism	718530164871819265	2016-04-08T20:05:15	RWhelanWSJ That's not what I'm arguing though. I'm saying the zoning should allow townhouses to replace detached single-fam
MarketUrbanism	718530049494921218	2016-04-08T20:04:48	RWhelanWSJ Fun fact: new construction (post-2000) townhouses in East NY trade for a bit under pre-war houses there

MarketUrbanism	718527144880685060	2016-04-08T19:53:15	RWhelanWSJ Traditionally, before Bloomberg zoned it all out, there were opportunities in these areas to do cheaper bldg typologies
MarketUrbanism	718527015306051585	2016-04-08T19:52:44	RWhelanWSJ And this is comparing apples to oranges. The ENY market-rate zoning is for mid-rises – elevators, parking, etc.

MarketUrbanism	715237133301075968	2016-03-30T17:59:55	Furmadamadam Irony of the forced east-to-west shift is that they probably spent more on tax breaks than they would've on just improving...
MarketUrbanism	715236928535314432	2016-03-30T17:59:06	Furmadamadam ...which created a mad rush to build and then a glut that still hasn't fully cleared a generation later.
MarketUrbanism	715236856917540864	2016-03-30T17:58:49	Furmadamadam Yeah, that Eichner book is great! There was an expiring density bonus &amp; tax break for the area north of TImes Sq...
MarketUrbanism	715236735387566081	2016-03-30T17:58:20	Furmadamadam Mercifully, the city is about to give Midtown East a proper upzoning though
MarketUrbanism	715236472698355713	2016-03-30T17:57:18	Furmadamadam ...that it's justified (you get higher ceilings &amp; shift mass to get more park views with the 25% loophole than simple reclad)
MarketUrbanism	715236286248968192	2016-03-30T17:56:33	Furmadamadam Obviously a lot more $$$ to redev while leaving 25% of old structure intact, but recently rents have gotten high enough...
MarketUrbanism	715236161522909184	2016-03-30T17:56:04	Furmadamadam Yup. Although there's a loophole if you leave 25% of the existing structure intact, hence 425 Park: 
MarketUrbanism	715235823780814849	2016-03-30T17:54:43	Furmadamadam ...at great expense by upzoning the west side and downzoning the east side, and lavishing tax breaks on the west side
MarketUrbanism	715235730759540738	2016-03-30T17:54:21	Furmadamadam The big postwar Midtown planning story is the city trying to shift development from east to west, and they accomplished it...
MarketUrbanism	715235493944893445	2016-03-30T17:53:24	Furmadamadam Zoning was changed to allow less density than before (upzoned = rezoned for higher density)

MarketUrbanism	715003893319655428	2016-03-30T02:33:06	But it never works – contract complexity ends up deterring smaller bidders who can't afford the lawyers, and stamps out bidder innovation

MarketUrbanism	707052755844784128	2016-03-08T03:58:08	spollck AYReport lol, Norman refuses to acknowledge in the face of staggering evidence that this project was a bad bet for FCR
MarketUrbanism	707052193514459137	2016-03-08T03:55:53	AYReport Given how effortlessly lucrative you think this all is, I'm puzzled about why you aren't in real estate yourself

MarketUrbanism	707042406731010048	2016-03-08T03:17:00	NickHannula Who knows? William Fischel has argued that the 1970s wave of growth controls were a reaction to interstate building
MarketUrbanism	707040162203746305	2016-03-08T03:08:05	Could argue that Moses's obstructionism &amp; continued building made zoning more virulent, radicalizing people like the Jacobses against growth
MarketUrbanism	707039929067577345	2016-03-08T03:07:09	On the other hand, I haven't looked tooo deeply into it, but killed early 1950s version of the zoning code did allow more density than 1961
MarketUrbanism	707039564616040450	2016-03-08T03:05:43	...there is a huge swath of the cities that is urban, dense, walkable, etc. because of Moses's zoning code obstructionism.
MarketUrbanism	707039411737853952	2016-03-08T03:05:06	Moses's opposition to the code was surely rooted more in its potential to get in the way of his urban renewal plans, but nevertheless, ...
MarketUrbanism	707039304015593472	2016-03-08T03:04:40	He wrote a bunch of bromides about Moses obstructing rational planning for parks and schools, as if the 1961 zoning code did any of that.
MarketUrbanism	707039185060892672	2016-03-08T03:04:12	Interestingly, Robert Caro, despite clearly being on the side of transit and urbanism, criticizes Moses for this.
MarketUrbanism	707038914159239168	2016-03-08T03:03:07	Moses' opponents – Robert Weinberg, Jane Jacobs's husband – were in favor. It's done more damage to urbanism in NYC than Moses.
MarketUrbanism	707038179434569728	2016-03-08T03:00:12	Robert Moses did one great thing for urbanism in New York City that is NEVER recognized: he delayed the terrible new zoning code till 1961.

MarketUrbanism	707034003296096256	2016-03-08T02:43:37	samnoble Allowing teardowns of large lot homes and redevelopment as townhouses/small lot homes would boost single-fam supply to meet demand
MarketUrbanism	707031832513134593	2016-03-08T02:34:59	Surprise surprise, forcing all new supply into condo towers makes single-family attached &amp; detached prices go crazy 
MarketUrbanism	707004449856888832	2016-03-08T00:46:11	eparillon lol, how does being allowed to build "off-site" in a city as thoroughly gentrified/zoned out as SF even help?
MarketUrbanism	707003594147536896	2016-03-08T00:42:46	devin_mb alon_levy I meant for regional rail (connecting one of NJ's terminals and Atlantic Terminal):

MarketUrbanism	707002619320004608	2016-03-08T00:38:54	ISANobody_ Yeah, it's wildly inaccurate. Probably biased towards new construction since those are by definition likely to be on the market
MarketUrbanism	707002510532333569	2016-03-08T00:38:28	devin_mb alon_levy It's just such a stubby line in Manhattan that nobody wants to be run through it

MarketUrbanism	706999156091572224	2016-03-08T00:25:08	The other day I had someone suggest the far Lower East Side.
MarketUrbanism	706999037078192128	2016-03-08T00:24:40	If you asked me, I'd say Williamsbridge or Brighton Beach or something. But a lot of people will be like, "You mean like, Ditmas Park?"
MarketUrbanism	706998887576440832	2016-03-08T00:24:04	Funny thing to do when talking to real estate people: ask a question that gets them to say what they consider the "fringes" of NYC to be
