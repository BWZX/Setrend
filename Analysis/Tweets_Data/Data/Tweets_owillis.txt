owillis	724753861248995329	2016-04-26T00:16:00	and it isn't a license for clinton to return to her previous, cautious positions. particularly on issues of war and peace, like iraq.

owillis	723315359600746496	2016-04-22T00:59:54	you don't have to say crazy things to win dem primaries/caucuses. its required for gop. look what it did to mitt, mccain.

owillis	723314425365716992	2016-04-22T00:56:12	and as much has been made of hrc being "pushed left" and sanders being liberal, neither has used as much unelectable rhetoric as gop field
owillis	723314183509540864	2016-04-22T00:55:14	and the only reason they tolerated bush's "im going to explicitly fake it" plan was because they lost back to back elections.
owillis	723313878101299201	2016-04-22T00:54:01	last republican to win the presidency had to run in primary with promise he was gonna bullshit all the way to wh (bush)
owillis	723313743044718592	2016-04-22T00:53:29	the biggest obstacle to republicans winning the white house is their own primary system.
owillis	723313642591145984	2016-04-22T00:53:05	its weird how the right never learns from the last two cycles of "say crazy shit to get gop nomination, hope it blows over by november"

owillis	723015898492100608	2016-04-21T05:09:57	wow 
owillis	723015691327004672	2016-04-21T05:09:08	but yes, there is a big difference between sanders and obama. obama won a lot more, got the delegates he needed and beat the establishment.
owillis	723015507847180288	2016-04-21T05:08:24	obama was not backed by party elites. they all counted him out in 2008 and he + dean pioneered small money donations 
owillis	723015237138440193	2016-04-21T05:07:20	besides the little thing of being elected president of the united states... 
owillis	723014895990509568	2016-04-21T05:05:58	but that win led to other wins which led to the house/senate in 2006. i still remember establishment saying it was impossible
owillis	723014682450124800	2016-04-21T05:05:07	but at the time, when everyone said dems couldnt be elected to *anything* esp in red states, it was a big deal. 
owillis	723014279201312768	2016-04-21T05:03:31	sometimes its disappointing. stephanie herseth, one of first big netroots wins, turned out to be a super right wing dem.
owillis	723014143117168641	2016-04-21T05:02:59	maybe some of this has to do with how a "revolution" starts. we didnt start w wh started w house seats, etc. pushing for netroots candidates
owillis	723013647883075584	2016-04-21T05:01:01	owillis Kids these days...don't think anything that happened before they started paying attention actually happened.

owillis	723013161775824896	2016-04-21T04:59:05	dem establishment circa 2002 thought netroots was crazy. 4 years later, they had powered winning house, senate, then wh. stuff happens.
owillis	723012908850896896	2016-04-21T04:58:05	maybe theyll sustain their momentum, but they've lost the first big battle (which doesnt mean you lose the wider war)
owillis	723012671310680064	2016-04-21T04:57:08	but sanders is not going to be the nominee. he did not attract enough people to beat the establishment candidate. it happens.
owillis	723012418209636353	2016-04-21T04:56:08	and on the gop side, both barry goldwater and now apparently trump were more successful as well. but sanders outperformed bradley, dean
owillis	723012245836296193	2016-04-21T04:55:26	sanders is one of the most successful insurgent candidates in history of democratic party, but obama was more successful
owillis	723012015254474757	2016-04-21T04:54:32	i dunno why so many sanders fans have to say their candidate is unprecedented, when its quite precedented. he's done well, but not enough

owillis	721884542601179138	2016-04-18T02:14:21	actually obamacare was not one shot and was not small. it took 20+ years and affects millions. 
owillis	721884321846554624	2016-04-18T02:13:28	SAYING it is not DOING it. 
owillis	721884216846348288	2016-04-18T02:13:03	RobProvince and you support the old system and all it entailed.
owillis	721884140044435456	2016-04-18T02:12:45	EliLevinson fatimap72 JJGomez127 walks like a duck, acts like a duck. u guys talk like winning an election = magic.
owillis	721884018086658049	2016-04-18T02:12:16	you act as if the gop congress has done anything rational 
owillis	721883907583537157	2016-04-18T02:11:50	RobProvince right, you oppose it and i support it. i dont see what the point is in going round + round.
owillis	721883723290030082	2016-04-18T02:11:06	theres not enough bandwith right now to do both 
owillis	721883596823400448	2016-04-18T02:10:36	RobProvince yeah and youre opposed to that too. anything that covers more people.
owillis	721883069410443265	2016-04-18T02:08:30	JJGomez127 owillis A lot of BernieBots need a lesson in civics. They think POTUS has ultimate power like a king.
owillis	721883087634894848	2016-04-18T02:08:34	RobProvince hillarys not promising to repeal obamacare
owillis	721882790506196992	2016-04-18T02:07:23	RobProvince everyone must be sacrificed for fat profits and gop donors
owillis	721882363874144257	2016-04-18T02:05:42	yeah which is why her argument is effectively about keeping obama's changes in place, not magical sweeping changes 
owillis	721882202141802497	2016-04-18T02:05:03	RobProvince yes, u think 1 drug going to a tiny percentage of ppl who need it outweighs millions being denied care. got it.
owillis	721881696761683970	2016-04-18T02:03:03	and obama is a better, more persuasive politician than bernie sanders by several orders of magnitude. news alert: its not the presidency
owillis	721881533955579906	2016-04-18T02:02:24	RobProvince yeah people dying in the street in the uk! oh wait, they consistently rate their hc higher than we do ours.
owillis	721881388157440001	2016-04-18T02:01:49	and i admit im one of the people who thought obama winning in 08 would show the gop that people wanted some advances. they just locked in.
owillis	721881172113014784	2016-04-18T02:00:57	RobProvince yeah in the uk when u get sick they dont treat you based on your bank balance, the horror.
owillis	721881049861648384	2016-04-18T02:00:28	the house passed cap and trade under pelosi, obama would have signed it, senate block house passed DREAM act under pelosi, senate block

owillis	721880175491883009	2016-04-18T01:57:00	you can WANT single payer all you want. bernie sanders could be elected president in a 50 state landslide, there simply arent votes for it.
owillis	721879979571744768	2016-04-18T01:56:13	its so goddamned frustrating. it just happened. it literally just happened. 
owillis	721879867101417473	2016-04-18T01:55:46	because the biggest opposition to major progressive change isnt the white house. its congress. get a house/senate that passes this stuff.
owillis	721879711111127040	2016-04-18T01:55:09	if you want single payer you should ignore the presidential race. you should be organizing candidates for house, senate.
owillis	721879576788471808	2016-04-18T01:54:37	there were not enough votes for it even within the democratic party, let alone gop opposition 
owillis	721879025166258176	2016-04-18T01:52:26	arguing for single payer right now is like saying we're going to mars the second after neil armstrong's foot hit the lunar surface
owillis	721878822971404288	2016-04-18T01:51:37	.peterkohan there is nobody on the left srsly arguing vs single payer. its just not a realistic endeavor 6 yrs after obamacare.

owillis	720420191088156673	2016-04-14T01:15:32	the closest current pol id put to nixon on the personality fail scale is scott walker and look where he ended up
owillis	720419656335368192	2016-04-14T01:13:25	folks i understand how nixon won, and why. what im saying is, i cant understand how he got so far. a sweaty, dark eyed, mess.

owillis	720415732954038272	2016-04-14T00:57:50	carter beat reagan in maryland but reagan beat mondale. gop won *maryland* in back to back races, but ppl wanna second guess clinton 92 lol
owillis	720415189120618497	2016-04-14T00:55:40	owillis Turnout in Iowa drops by about a third in midterm elections as well. Drop-off bigger for no-party voters than for Ds or Rs.
owillis	720415284935307264	2016-04-14T00:56:03	last time gop won md was '88. which shows you the dire straits of the democratic party circa 1992 and clinton that ppl dont get
owillis	720414924782997504	2016-04-14T00:54:37	but thats 800,000 marylanders who just drop off the face of the earth in non-presidential years
owillis	720414476877434882	2016-04-14T00:52:50	and the dropoff is worse in other states
owillis	720414347214753794	2016-04-14T00:52:19	md turnout 2014 1.6 million 2012 2.5 million 2010 1.78 million 2008 2.5 million 2006 1.7 million

owillis	720413521939304448	2016-04-14T00:49:02	but maryland - freaking maryland! - should have a democratic governor
owillis	720413312559812609	2016-04-14T00:48:13	owillis cjprender We need to mark districts mathematically to avoid that crap:  
owillis	720413390888243201	2016-04-14T00:48:31	and tbh its not like larry hogan is some hardcore rw nutjob. he's a chamber of commerce republican. wont touch social issues.
owillis	720412763126796288	2016-04-14T00:46:02	breel_2 maybe but he still should have won. a warm body (D) should have won that race.
owillis	720412647997382656	2016-04-14T00:45:34	theres no reason a state that went 62% for obama and will prob duplicate that this year, has such a dropoff in midterms we go gop
owillis	720412342329020416	2016-04-14T00:44:21	still batting around my idea of creating a super pac that solely focuses on gotv for midterms. midterms only.
owillis	720412194064588800	2016-04-14T00:43:46	unfortunately maryland is the poster child for a strong democratic state where people didnt turn out for a midterm + we got a gop governor
owillis	720411957904289792	2016-04-14T00:42:50	md-1 is the eastern shore, which is maryland's only real gop territory. drove out there in 2004, giant bush signs

owillis	720411461332312064	2016-04-14T00:40:51	md-1 is our only gop district. dems held it for a minute, and the genius voted against obamacare and then still lost.

owillis	720409422716010496	2016-04-14T00:32:45	and in our district the primary IS the election. last few races, the dem (van hollen) got 60-70 percent of the vote
owillis	720409156088242176	2016-04-14T00:31:42	thing is, in md-8, we're unlikely to get another corporate dem like al wynn again, so any one of these folks would be fine
owillis	720408884930674691	2016-04-14T00:30:37	DemocratMachine i think so
owillis	720408837996449792	2016-04-14T00:30:26	u jest, but...

owillis	720406829470130181	2016-04-14T00:22:27	thats the race with the wine mogul and kathleen matthews, former tv anchor and wife of chris matthews
owillis	720406688428232709	2016-04-14T00:21:53	might vote for this guy in the md-8 primary
