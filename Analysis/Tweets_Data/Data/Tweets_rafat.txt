rafat	708698387823124480	2016-03-12T16:57:17	Jason rafat Phocuswright this kind of presentation is BS. Made to rob money than helping entrepreneurs
rafat	708693022142124032	2016-03-12T16:35:58	Jason rafat Phocuswright you don't need investors if you can pay $17.5k to demo. That's an expensive sales demo at a conference price
rafat	708692343499522049	2016-03-12T16:33:16	Startup founders: never fall for this nonsense! Pay for a reasonable ticket, sure... Pay $17,500 to get on stage. No 
rafat	708688940002181120	2016-03-12T16:19:44	joehas rafat spend that time on making your company great, not winning accolades from the startup community.
rafat	708687287744331776	2016-03-12T16:13:10	rafat it's total BS. It's also a Darwin test for startups, it you pay its a good indicator you are going to run out of money.

rafat	708682223961169920	2016-03-12T15:53:03	What's the current sentiment on charging startups to present on stage in pitch-type events? Still see conferences do it openly.
rafat	708671650506645504	2016-03-12T15:11:02	Definitely worth a listen, this episode.  
rafat	708656307184623616	2016-03-12T14:10:04	rafat hunkering down and truly servicing a niche takes time and effort. Most aren't willing to lay the ground work because it's hard work!
rafat	708656137336279040	2016-03-12T14:09:23	rafat many expand focus impatiently when the $ doesn't come right away. Then, the niche is diluted and broadened and even less appealing.
rafat	708655560464408576	2016-03-12T14:07:06	Most of the time lesson is: focus, patience and multi-stream revenues is what works in vertical. Mainstream media not structured for it.
rafat	708655275989987328	2016-03-12T14:05:58	asanwal mediagazer yes, one type of revenues doesn't work in vetricals.

rafat	708092911628509184	2016-03-11T00:51:20	gabestein then you may have worked at wrong kind of companies, the ones you chose in first place.
rafat	708082753439404036	2016-03-11T00:10:58	fbonacci yes indeed, it does exist. We talk about it a lot within our vertical media founders group &amp; work towards it.
rafat	708082317403791360	2016-03-11T00:09:14	The parallel but connected issue is world's quest for scale in a digital infinite userbase world. No one has time to invest in talent.
rafat	708080702533853185	2016-03-11T00:02:49	felixsalmon I agree with you there, systemic all around.
rafat	708079984359903232	2016-03-10T23:59:58	I think this is a systemic issue, confusing exposure with experience. Explosion of startups has enhanced this illusion of accessibility.
rafat	708079221252427776	2016-03-10T23:56:56	One thing I see/hear a lot: after a few job jumps, lots of them are confused, stalled, bored of previous work. Unsure of next moves.
rafat	708076851974021124	2016-03-10T23:47:31	All digital deluge of advice, on Medium/LinkedIn/Inc/Forbes etc, all send wrong signals; "hustle" "leverage" "brand of me." It all confuses.
rafat	708076038035791872	2016-03-10T23:44:17	tolles well, you can lead a horse to water...etc.
rafat	708075790198575104	2016-03-10T23:43:18	rafat I went to one of my alma maters' alumni career days and heard plenty of folks telling kids to bop around.
rafat	708075586154057729	2016-03-10T23:42:29	rafat I agree! But you don't hear enough of this. Young people are being told--certainly by university career centres--to hop and leverage.
rafat	708075148826517508	2016-03-10T23:40:45	joetaylorjr yeah, agencies are also at fault for chewing &amp; spitting out people, terrible work culture fosters it.
rafat	708074752284426240	2016-03-10T23:39:10	The digital deluge of career advice is dangerous, because it is meaningless &amp; superficial. This requires face to face work, mentors etc.
rafat	708074125634510849	2016-03-10T23:36:41	I would look at this as a crisis, if we want young talent of today to thrive and build great careers &amp; companies.
rafat	708073161590493188	2016-03-10T23:32:51	Very few think about meaningful work cultures &amp; are actually surprised when you talk to them about it, that such a thing exists.
rafat	708071756788080641	2016-03-10T23:27:16	For candidates that do jump a lot in a short time, I've never really gotten a satisfactory answer on why.
rafat	708071410753794048	2016-03-10T23:25:54	Surprised by how little thought goes into jumping from one job to other &amp; how little young folks think about trajectories of their careers.
rafat	708071052836888577	2016-03-10T23:24:28	Random thoughts on hiring/careers: I've interviewed few dozen candidates over last month for skift positions. Surprised by a few things...

rafat	694894398514061312	2016-02-03T14:45:09	There are assholes reading these tweets and laughing at us. Thank you for your contribution to building our business.
rafat	694892685849714689	2016-02-03T14:38:21	This is certainly the most hidebound risk-averse sector we're going into, everyone hates everyone in the corporate travel ecosystem.
rafat	694892139113811968	2016-02-03T14:36:11	Now we're starting corporate travel coverage, against decades-old incumbents who've spent lives in procurement/expense world. Deja vu time.
rafat	694891171554971648	2016-02-03T14:32:20	For years they said we can't cover meetings industry, too technical. We went into it last year, now we're most creative read 6 months later.
rafat	694890281087455232	2016-02-03T14:28:48	When we got into travel, people said we had no chance against "expert" incumbents. Same now as we expand into so-called specialized sectors.
rafat	694886503131037696	2016-02-03T14:13:47	Rewind: my "encounter" with Glenn Beck five years ago, back when he was more well known, for his assholery.

rafat	694726714690269184	2016-02-03T03:38:50	Interesting strategy from Airbnb: asking guest to stay extra day. Now if they can pay flight change fee... 
rafat	694677563906605056	2016-02-03T00:23:32	Now that Recode is part of a giant media unicorn, can they please please stop using clipart/stock pics for imagery? I love you all.

rafat	694608462840397824	2016-02-02T19:48:57	The only thing I can't see in the logo is what I need to see "U" for Uber. 
rafat	694618217700917248	2016-02-02T20:27:43	uber changed its logo so now it looks like a photo app so im prob gonna take drunk selfies instead of calling uber 
rafat	694627306715897856	2016-02-02T21:03:50	The low-key sociopathic yearning of Uber’s brand to be *the most human* puts Airbnb’s loathsome Beló thingy to shame.
rafat	694627272192581632	2016-02-02T21:03:41	So Wired, Verge, FastCompany and Mashable are all claiming "first look" at the new Uber logo. Who had the first appointment on PR day?
rafat	694625940731752448	2016-02-02T20:58:24	A modern day iconic logo has been stripped and replaced by something that resembles my cats regurgitated furball. RIP UBER Uber
rafat	694602590798020608	2016-02-02T19:25:37	congrats to uber for shaking its anxiously masculine dudebro image by literally making its new logo a dark sperm 
rafat	694603944803237889	2016-02-02T19:31:00	We've had a square in the middle of our logo for 7 years. Welcome to the club, Uber! 
rafat	694624474331615232	2016-02-02T20:52:34	Uber inexplicably changes its perfectly fine logo to weird lines:   You know that feeling you get ...  tech news
rafat	694624707698675713	2016-02-02T20:53:30	Wow, talk about completely unnecessary "transformation", Uber's font &amp; logo is so iconic, awe inspiring. Why??

rafat	683791001589276675	2016-01-03T23:24:13	Great rafat piece on building "Bootstrap+" businesses, which is how we built Curbed ($1.8m total raised):

rafat	683760619607162880	2016-01-03T21:23:30	Have heard from 5 of dozens &amp; dozens of investors who passed on us since I posted this, all gracious to a fault. Felt anticlimactic.

rafat	683718063741624320	2016-01-03T18:34:23	felixsalmon shafqatislam I'm gonna stay far away from this discussion, pointless unless or until it happens.
rafat	683703382830366720	2016-01-03T17:36:03	felixsalmon I raised $0.5mn for paidcontent, gave Greycroft 5X in two years. It wil happen, much much better but longer horizon.
rafat	683702905254350850	2016-01-03T17:34:09	We are now planning 2016 trip sometime may-june for a week, tossing between Morocco, Portugal, Istanbul, has to be 5-7 hr flight.
rafat	683702150623531008	2016-01-03T17:31:09	We spent about $15k-$20k for each trip, the returns for team/culture/work have been 10X, maybe priceless.

rafat	683664455734013952	2016-01-03T15:01:22	And that's it, bootstrap+ companies learn to be revenue-funded post that early-funding. Kickstarter has filled gap to certain type of cos.
rafat	683663971350638592	2016-01-03T14:59:27	There's a hole in market: a class of investors/funds who invest in what I call bootstrap+ companies, enough money to get product-mkt fit.
rafat	683663501030744070	2016-01-03T14:57:35	One question I'm getting asked after this: would we have been able to be here without investors? Real answer: no. 
rafat	683648882472005632	2016-01-03T13:59:29	"Hey Rafat, I read your great article, would love to pick your brain." Actually, I don't think you did.

rafat	683393285977731072	2016-01-02T21:03:50	Also almost all are media investors, they know it is a long haul game. Also they're less diluted, so helps!
rafat	683393058596065280	2016-01-02T21:02:56	Some are asking how our seed investors feel about this: each I've known for years, some decades. They know I'll make it work, any which way.
rafat	683388891966115841	2016-01-02T20:46:23	gerstenzang DanielleMorrill tiny amount from each, they're there when I need them, but they're not losing sleep over us, understandably.

rafat	683318491051614208	2016-01-02T16:06:38	felixsalmon yes, working even more for your own sake.
rafat	683317613758410752	2016-01-02T16:03:09	felixsalmon lots slower, I suppose, sure, like a 1-2 person newsletter. My next biz will likely be that.
rafat	683317326784139264	2016-01-02T16:02:00	felixsalmon hence when you go in venture route, everyone tells you scale is only way. And initial funding it definitely key.
rafat	683316835958259712	2016-01-02T16:00:03	felixsalmon thanks! we couldn't have done without initial money, but venture money not structured to just do small initial funding.
rafat	683312648172244993	2016-01-02T15:43:25	This is how we define scale.
