conradhackett	689133213889859584	2016-01-18T17:12:16	mims Argument is that extreme poverty is down while wealth inequality is up. Headline likely to mislead many readers, I suspect.
conradhackett	689131825034309632	2016-01-18T17:06:45	mims It's a misleading headline problem. The first few paragraphs of Wired story explain Oxfam is concerned about widening inequality.
