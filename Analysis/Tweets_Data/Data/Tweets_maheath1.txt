maheath1	713361906564620288	2016-03-25T13:48:26	GrayConnolly prior_robin You do know Gray that he's one of the world's foremost military historians?
maheath1	713342938600747008	2016-03-25T12:33:04	GrayConnolly It has terrible governments. only thing worse, as my mother-in-law reminds me when I whinge, is when there's no government.
maheath1	713340920477851649	2016-03-25T12:25:03	GrayConnolly It's very sad. You wonder what the country could've achieved without the mass murder, exile, displacement and destruction.
maheath1	713339861193740290	2016-03-25T12:20:50	GrayConnolly too true. I lived in Moscow for a few years and found the family. They said always give thanks to your grandfather.
maheath1	713339421047697408	2016-03-25T12:19:05	GrayConnolly Philip Adams had the brains and info to know better. Agree.
maheath1	713339054050267140	2016-03-25T12:17:38	GrayConnolly that's the reality of life in that era. Not clear cut lines. Anyway, I'm rambling now.

maheath1	713338232788746241	2016-03-25T12:14:22	GrayConnolly other became senior officer and v powerful. 10 years after war, one in camps told recant and would be freed. Told them to GGF
maheath1	713337805519265792	2016-03-25T12:12:40	GrayConnolly 2 youngest fought for Red Army in WWII. One during '41 crisis said Stalin sold country to Nazis. Straight to camps...cont.
maheath1	713337232845705216	2016-03-25T12:10:24	GrayConnolly he evacuated to Paris and helped homeless kids (generally viewed as smartest and best). Rest of the family stuck in USSR cont
maheath1	713336908529553408	2016-03-25T12:09:06	GrayConnolly In my maternal grandmother's family, the brothers split: eldest fought for tsar. The one not killed fought for whites...cont.
maheath1	713336250762076160	2016-03-25T12:06:29	GrayConnolly It wasn't red at the start. It was an elected government.
maheath1	713335864407891968	2016-03-25T12:04:57	GrayConnolly And with the Nazis. That was a horrifying discovery for me at the time. I give them a pass for ignorance/hatred of Stalin now.
maheath1	713335056295526400	2016-03-25T12:01:45	GrayConnolly Are you seriously saying in the middle of the depression, amid all that suffering, communism wouldn't have an honest appeal?
maheath1	713334566157623296	2016-03-25T11:59:48	GrayConnolly Very few decisions by the Brits in the 30s stand historical scrutiny. By your logic, they should've done a deal in 1940, no?
maheath1	713333808607547392	2016-03-25T11:56:47	GrayConnolly I know. But that was once they were there.
maheath1	713332204504395777	2016-03-25T11:50:25	GrayConnolly Munich was realpolitik too.
maheath1	713331971972202497	2016-03-25T11:49:29	GrayConnolly The descent into madness or truth exposed only came in the late 30s. I don't accept IBers were equivalent of NKVD then.
maheath1	713331432534331392	2016-03-25T11:47:21	GrayConnolly The Brits sympathised with Franco and blockaded the government. Another of their great moves at the time, along with Munich.
maheath1	713330808837124096	2016-03-25T11:44:52	GrayConnolly I understand. But no Communist in 1936 understood what Stalinism really meant. First really obvious chance was 1937.
maheath1	713329845124464642	2016-03-25T11:41:02	GrayConnolly Harsh, perhaps ahistorical. Stalinism was only just REALLY getting going. I think most were Orwell type, if not as wonderful.
maheath1	713328613769097216	2016-03-25T11:36:09	GrayConnolly I am Russian Orthodox. You'd love the White emigre community!!
maheath1	713328440238157824	2016-03-25T11:35:27	GrayConnolly I thought it showed honour on his part. You can't seriously believe a Lincoln brigade volunteer understood Stalinism then?
maheath1	713325309328629760	2016-03-25T11:23:01	GrayConnolly I'm no fan of McCain or Communists. But this an exception. John McCain: Salute to a Communist

maheath1	713322532040904704	2016-03-25T11:11:59	GrayConnolly Hope so.
maheath1	713317167442202624	2016-03-25T10:50:40	GrayConnolly Interesting. I did appreciate your comment on unions in the piece too. Society needs a balance of forces.
maheath1	713316592096907265	2016-03-25T10:48:22	GrayConnolly Must part ways with you there as I think that's archaic. But the worst marital cheaters I know all claim to be "conservative."
maheath1	713312335377485824	2016-03-25T10:31:28	GrayConnolly you sound like Chris Kenny and you're smarter. My dad was a Tory. Yet his hero was Curtin for his leadership. Takes all sorts.
