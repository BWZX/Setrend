mdudas	703354757570654208	2016-02-26T23:03:36	JoshConstine The notion of shutting down a money-moving API with no warning is so outlandish, it would have been worth the test.
mdudas	703354406578708480	2016-02-26T23:02:12	JoshConstine "no longer offer access" must have meant no new success. A Splitwise or Papa John's test txn could have confirmed "shut down"
mdudas	703353772886478848	2016-02-26T22:59:41	JoshConstine That would imply that the API is not "shut down", as it is supporting transactions for current users.
mdudas	703353678422364160	2016-02-26T22:59:19	JoshConstine Bill was pretty clear in his tweet. Venmo has shut down access to the API to new users, but it is supporting existing users.

mdudas	700469530452033537	2016-02-18T23:58:44	modestproposal1 I believe that Nickelodeon is a "must have" network (Kids). Obviously if Viacom has no "must have", there's zero leverage
mdudas	700469351959244800	2016-02-18T23:58:02	modestproposal1 And Viacom is desperate for the revenue on carriage side given declining ratings and corresponding ad revenue decline.
mdudas	700469251346272256	2016-02-18T23:57:38	modestproposal1 So Viacom is still a bargain relative to others, but of course understand why the increase is brutal to accept.

mdudas	700437438720819200	2016-02-18T21:51:13	2) Square Cash takes 1-2 days to deposit to your debit card in some cases, just like Venmo. 
mdudas	700437142946869249	2016-02-18T21:50:03	1) Venmo is not holding anyone's money "hostage." 1-2 day bank deposits are fairly fast. This is a bank issue, not a Venmo issue.

mdudas	697889095977033732	2016-02-11T21:05:01	There is no data that selling in 3rd party apps/sites (Buy Button, hosted stores, etc. works) Optimized mobile apps work well for retailers.
mdudas	697888623107047424	2016-02-11T21:03:08	Mobile retailers should put every ounce of focus into: 1) Optimizing mobile apps for conversion. 2) Optimizing marketing for app acqusition.
mdudas	697877411627532288	2016-02-11T20:18:35	Official 2016 word that sounds like a meaningless buzzword but is exceptionally powerful for retail &amp; advertising: "Contextual commerce."

mdudas	697875890944897024	2016-02-11T20:12:32	The good news for PayPal/Braintree is that they control the payment flows in many of top merchant apps (Uber, Airbnb, StubHub, etc.)
mdudas	697875686359322625	2016-02-11T20:11:44	Yet Button believes that Buy Buttons &amp; hosted transactions confuse consumers. They want to purchase in highly optimized merchant apps.
mdudas	697875347644112896	2016-02-11T20:10:23	And PayPal believes that merchants can move beyond Buy Buttons to rich purchase experiences in 3rd party environments.
mdudas	697875165577740288	2016-02-11T20:09:40	Whereas button believes that the purchase should happen in the merchant app, which converts best, PayPal believes "Buy Buttons" will work.
mdudas	697875012984770560	2016-02-11T20:09:03	To clarify, button and paypal agree that the typical mobile purchase journey starts outside of a retailer / merchant app.

mdudas	697553014253449216	2016-02-10T22:49:33	It's very hard to fake a transaction. Much harder than committing grand scale ad larceny.
mdudas	697552801480617985	2016-02-10T22:48:42	This is why companies like Button that aren't ads and that charge only on actions (installs and purchase) will win in mobile monetization.

mdudas	690929776886947840	2016-01-23T16:11:10	RurikBradbury Jim_Edwards That's the real question. What % of iOS users bolt. 7-10%+ of best users is not trivial.
mdudas	690928985417588736	2016-01-23T16:08:01	AntDeRosa they will if he spends $1B on TV ads.
mdudas	690928859336839168	2016-01-23T16:07:31	basche42 My point is that if you strip Google search and services off of iOS, it would hurt device sales. Apple cares. Not gonna happen.
mdudas	690928593640296448	2016-01-23T16:06:28	basche42 Ok. The evidence is pretty clear that Google mobile services are far superior to Apple's. Your scenario would compromise iOS.
mdudas	690928351809310720	2016-01-23T16:05:30	basche42 In other words, both companies profit from the arrangement. The advertisers "pay Apple"
mdudas	690928174503497728	2016-01-23T16:04:48	basche42 No. Google pays Apple a traffic acquisition cost for publisher inventory. Just like any 3rd party as deal. They need each other.
mdudas	690927987718557696	2016-01-23T16:04:03	basche42 Jim_Edwards C'mon man!
mdudas	690927759833587714	2016-01-23T16:03:09	basche42 Jim_Edwards they will be if Google searches are "shut off" from iOS. In any case, it's a far out scenario.
mdudas	690927580170551296	2016-01-23T16:02:26	Furthermore, an iOS device without Google Search would be hugely compromised. It's fun to talk up the end of search, but Google's essential.

mdudas	689684685551714305	2016-01-20T05:43:37	basche42 chrismessina I've used the concierge apps and found them to take more time and provide worse results than self search at higher $
mdudas	689684459831087104	2016-01-20T05:42:43	chrismessina There is at least one merchant app I love for every commerce use case: shopping, traveling, eating, tickets, grocery, etc.
mdudas	689684212044140545	2016-01-20T05:41:44	chrismessina Apps! I find the ones I use most frequently work well for me. Not recorded in "time spent" or normal app measurement metrics.
mdudas	689683839615176704	2016-01-20T05:40:15	cdixon Retailers, not many. But tons of services companies like Uber, Instacart, Maple, Seamless, Airbnb, etc. Doubt these move to chat.
mdudas	689681387440488448	2016-01-20T05:30:31	cdixon Also, most merchants will still have apps, so now they'll be managing another customer service and sales interaction point. Chaos.
mdudas	689681278933794816	2016-01-20T05:30:05	cdixon We'll be moving traditional merchants from 3rd parties producing their apps to 3rd parties shaping text-based purchase flow.
mdudas	689680981494734852	2016-01-20T05:28:54	cdixon And if we move beyond customer service to actual purchasing, won't it be just as hard to design the tech around assisted purchases?
mdudas	689680781866864640	2016-01-20T05:28:06	cdixon But I've yet to see that on customer service Twitter or in most live chat interactions I've had with Verizon and others.
mdudas	689679674994233344	2016-01-20T05:23:42	grmeyer But it's easy to organize into folders and hide from main screen. With Spotlight, very easy to find the folder-ed / hidden apps.
mdudas	689679512431370240	2016-01-20T05:23:04	pbreit chrismessina Same thing. I've created a few "Contacts" for businesses, and it's starting to clog up &amp; confuse my contact list.
mdudas	689679292108775425	2016-01-20T05:22:11	grmeyer Twitter shows you "reach" via the impressions metric, I believe. And you can see engagement metrics as well. Just not the "who."
mdudas	689678619673808896	2016-01-20T05:19:31	I also believe that we've reached peak "people don't want to install apps" and "it's so hard to install apps." It takes under 10 seconds!!
