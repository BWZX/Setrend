BetseyStevenson	726193669393375232	2016-04-29T23:37:17	dannywanny8 I don't think that you know what advice is.
BetseyStevenson	726190450634162176	2016-04-29T23:24:30	Advice that siphons off a large share of your retirement savings is not cheap. It is not useful. Ending it is good. 
BetseyStevenson	726168894897975297	2016-04-29T21:58:50	Do you want financial advice that is not in your interest? Republicans are doing their best to help banks screw you.

BetseyStevenson	725808723541774336	2016-04-28T22:07:39	irin JustinWolfers Or listening to a guy mansplain economics to the most powerful economist in the world (Nader's mansplain to Yellen)
BetseyStevenson	725805391066619904	2016-04-28T21:54:24	My advice to young women everywhere, if you want to have fun slapping down mansplainers, study economics.  
BetseyStevenson	725748350033776640	2016-04-28T18:07:45	I wish people would stop obsessing over where people go to pee. It's weird, It's illogical. It's bullying. Real people are being hurt by it.
BetseyStevenson	725710499606745090	2016-04-28T15:37:20	bethmorgan And believable. That's what's so terrifying. I really believe Boehner.
BetseyStevenson	725702995850059776	2016-04-28T15:07:31	Regardless of your policy views a WH led by a "miserable son of a bitch" who is "Lucifer in the flesh" is terrifying 
BetseyStevenson	725702307069874176	2016-04-28T15:04:47	Regardless of what you think of Obama's policies, his White House is a fair, open &amp; cohesive place and that leads to good decision-making.
BetseyStevenson	725698990675619840	2016-04-28T14:51:36	His testimony was fantastic.TheBudgetGuy is my hero.  
BetseyStevenson	725319484358164480	2016-04-27T13:43:35	I think he meant "to women" 
BetseyStevenson	725293191465848833	2016-04-27T11:59:06	Whenever Trump says "the woman card" his belief in women's inferiority is palpable.
BetseyStevenson	716053237980336129	2016-04-02T00:02:50	joshbivens_DC mettlinger Josh thanks for replying-I turn twitter off when working. Reductions reflect aging labor force plus other factors
BetseyStevenson	716052664170258432	2016-04-02T00:00:33	Assuming growth in the labor force of 1% is likely too high given the continued aging of the baby boomers 
BetseyStevenson	715891581484720128	2016-04-01T13:20:28	Much is aging-baby boomers are retiring &amp; there are lots of 'em. But prime age participation is down &amp; its troubling 
BetseyStevenson	715885084763668480	2016-04-01T12:54:39	The most striking thing about this economic expansion is just how relentless it has been. Every month we're getting people back to work.
BetseyStevenson	715881128071184384	2016-04-01T12:38:56	The economy only needs to add around 80k jobs/month to keep unemployment stable. Current growth &gt;200k will keep getting folks back to work.
BetseyStevenson	715880329257549825	2016-04-01T12:35:45	I keep hearing fears that the economy is slowing. But employers aren't listening: The economy just keeps adding jobs. Month after month.
BetseyStevenson	714854882549833728	2016-03-29T16:41:00	You are surprised by this? If Trump isn't hiring the stripper biting lawyer, who is? 
BetseyStevenson	710570354721173504	2016-03-17T20:55:48	I wonder what his prenuptial agreements say if this is what he is asking of volunteers.

BetseyStevenson	707767068951711744	2016-03-10T03:16:33	I disagree. Vacancies would be a great question. Presidential candidates second guessing Fed decisions not so much. 
BetseyStevenson	707757024914894849	2016-03-10T02:36:38	But not as sad as hearing the racism that Trump spews.  
BetseyStevenson	707702605540040704	2016-03-09T23:00:24	Here's the plot: Duck runs for office &amp; has fun. Duck wins but hates the work of being Pres. Trump should read it. 
BetseyStevenson	707700180817027072	2016-03-09T22:50:46	What would we teach our children about shouting &amp; name-calling if we had President Trump? Would a Trump victory mean the end of civility?
BetseyStevenson	707328301824614401	2016-03-08T22:13:03	How do we bridge the gap btwn PC over-intensification on college campuses &amp; the anything-goes offensiveness of the Republican primary?
BetseyStevenson	707049626327769088	2016-03-08T03:45:41	We can &amp; must use policy solutions to boost labor force participation rates. Economists are largley in agreement. 
BetseyStevenson	705785687300243456	2016-03-04T16:03:15	This is what terrifies me 
BetseyStevenson	705780517908697088	2016-03-04T15:42:42	We all know that correlation doesn't equal causation. The causal estimates of the earnings return to schooling is 8% 
BetseyStevenson	705775761169448960	2016-03-04T15:23:48	Great chart by CEA breaking down who is in our broadest definition unemployment.  
BetseyStevenson	705775116874092544	2016-03-04T15:21:15	The good news is that wage growth--while small--is benefiting workers throughout the wage distribution. 
BetseyStevenson	705754816086040577	2016-03-04T14:00:35	christophemm1  it's todays job report from the BLS
BetseyStevenson	705754135241605121	2016-03-04T13:57:52	Instead of my twitter feed being full of wonkish analysis of the jobs report, it is wonkish analysis interspersed with "hand" size jokes.
BetseyStevenson	705753583015297024	2016-03-04T13:55:41	Education  Unempt rate of college grads: 2.5%  Unempt of high school only: 5.3% Empt rate of college grads: 72%  Empt rate of HS only: 54.5%
BetseyStevenson	705751765245935616	2016-03-04T13:48:27	This is troubling. The biggest wage gains historically came from job changes since they were a promotion/better fit 
BetseyStevenson	705750501799768064	2016-03-04T13:43:26	There's clearly still slack in the labor market, but the problem with wages goes deeper than that.
BetseyStevenson	705749428481601537	2016-03-04T13:39:10	The labor force grew by over half a million people in February and so did the number employed--with a 4.9 percent unemployment rate.
BetseyStevenson	705748384758505472	2016-03-04T13:35:01	Participation rate and employment rate are both up, job gains continue to be strong. Our intractable problem: wages.
BetseyStevenson	705219997006733313	2016-03-03T02:35:24	It's hard to stop watching this 
BetseyStevenson	704792179554779136	2016-03-01T22:15:24	Democrats need both the Democratic and Republican parties to be strong. What's happening to the Republican party is bad for everyone.
BetseyStevenson	704791490728435712	2016-03-01T22:12:40	TimesVerySmart Yep, it was a typo.
BetseyStevenson	704760406682836992	2016-03-01T20:09:09	If only it was less empathy, I fear that it is more antipathy for people who aren't like them. 
BetseyStevenson	704759558523260929	2016-03-01T20:05:47	I hope people voting in primaries remember that sensible, policy-driven political parties (plural!) are crucial for a health democracy.
BetseyStevenson	704388523735040000	2016-02-29T19:31:25	Numeracy is the key to higher wages. Why aren't we teaching it better? Great article on what we are getting wrong:

BetseyStevenson	700525481217490945	2016-02-19T03:41:04	Child care workers provide an essential investment in our country. We need to pay them more. 
BetseyStevenson	699001687348891648	2016-02-14T22:46:03	Great conversation with wendy_harmer &amp; JustinWolfers on the Republican debate and the US Presidential race.

BetseyStevenson	687841732956794881	2016-01-15T03:40:23	No Republicans most Americans don't have inelastic demand for Chinese made goods.
BetseyStevenson	687024786510331908	2016-01-12T21:34:08	So exciting 2 see so much momentum 4 paid sick days. Excited to hear the call for paid sick days echoed in SOTU. 
BetseyStevenson	685557253076840449	2016-01-08T20:22:40	Surprise! Women get too little credit for joint work. justinwolfers details a problem that fails to surprise women 
BetseyStevenson	685464090890862592	2016-01-08T14:12:29	Totally agree, it's hard to interpret wage data since the data reflect both growth in wages &amp;  compositional changes 
BetseyStevenson	685461410764173312	2016-01-08T14:01:50	Even w/ low unempt overall education matters: Unemployment rate: Less than high school 6.7% High school 5.6% Some college 4.1% College 2.5%
BetseyStevenson	685460110181822464	2016-01-08T13:56:40	Upward revisions of job growth of 50K for the previous 2 months is great news &amp; further evidence that job growth is continuing.

BetseyStevenson	682994363220279296	2016-01-01T18:38:40	dandolfa perhaps. My point is that disappointingly academics tend to develop views &amp; hold them dogmatically-even when the evidence changes.
BetseyStevenson	682397420664320000	2015-12-31T03:06:38	dandolfa I don't agree w/ that at all. It's rare to see people stay intellectually flexible but perhaps you are now too rigid to understand
BetseyStevenson	681920378571079680	2015-12-29T19:31:02	Kocherlakota is a rare academic &amp; policy maker who adjusts his views based on information. We need more be like him.

BetseyStevenson	672785318207217664	2015-12-04T14:31:34	The jobs report highlights the absurdity of efforts to repeal a policy that expanded health coverage, slowed cost growth &amp; ended job-lock.

BetseyStevenson	672510985345871872	2015-12-03T20:21:28	The issue is guns and policy makers refusal to even begin to discuss policy solutions for fear of upsetting the NRA. 
BetseyStevenson	672509485139828736	2015-12-03T20:15:30	People respond to incentives: if you make it harder (i.e. more costly) to vote people will do less of it.  
BetseyStevenson	672507903337734144	2015-12-03T20:09:13	Which is worse: facing hassles buying a gun or traveling by plane? And which threatens the public more?  
BetseyStevenson	672167540685189120	2015-12-02T21:36:44	How can we explain to our children that we let this happen over and over again?  Key ingredient to mass shootings is easy access to guns.
BetseyStevenson	672157728685584385	2015-12-02T20:57:45	When do we get fed up and do something? I'm praying for the victims and for our policymakers to do something. 
BetseyStevenson	669566708961697793	2015-11-25T17:21:58	His letter was also ignorant of monetary policy. But when has ignorance ever stopped mansplaining?

BetseyStevenson	666616312894873600	2015-11-17T13:58:08	Here's a connection between terrorism &amp; domestic mass killings: The same stupid arguments are used.
