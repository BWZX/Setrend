JeremyWS	697021501040627712	2016-02-09T11:37:30	Peak divergence occurred in 2014.. however this still gives room for EURUSD higher, but you have to favour longer term downside on any spike
JeremyWS	697021159112642560	2016-02-09T11:36:09	some ppl talk about peak divergence b/w US and Europe.. I'd argue we are close to peak convergence looking at 2y2y

JeremyWS	689459398993833985	2016-01-19T14:48:24	The day oil finally reverses (be it at 25, 20 or 15) and the CTA industry implodes on the mammoth unwind that follows will be a joyous one

JeremyWS	684550748240220160	2016-01-06T01:43:11	profplum99 even more reason to take this trade then? If spread is a f(x) of short term cap flows then buying CNYCNH 6m fwd at 1 makes sense
JeremyWS	684549291914952704	2016-01-06T01:37:24	profplum99 where tho? Only happened since Aug PBoC.. Presume mkt sees convergence in CNH to CNY, but not in 3 or 6months...

JeremyWS	684503856466792452	2016-01-05T22:36:51	georgepearkes that's not huge tho... Say a 10k payout, that's only 50k delta?.. Tiny. Pennies. Plus positive convex. (I own this haha)

JeremyWS	684431462947500033	2016-01-05T17:49:11	@MacroBanter nah 5s are probably cheap on the curve, especially on 5s10s30s etc.. prefer to do in 10s here.
JeremyWS	684428441131872256	2016-01-05T17:37:11	Same picture in european credit. Eurostoxx ~130 points cheap to HY. Buy Equity, sell credit. top RV trade right now

JeremyWS	684070693051461633	2016-01-04T17:55:37	CDX HY session lows (after 20 point gap up), decent for risk here. If at these levels tmrw am, will sell some xover 
JeremyWS	684054513616064512	2016-01-04T16:51:19	which both worked pretty well thus far but looking at FX diverge, makes sense for the same "trade" to rejiggle into FX rather than rates now
JeremyWS	684054253867003904	2016-01-04T16:50:17	JeremyWS in rates, L curve is still very flat, but nowhere near what it was.. so far I've taken to steepeners here and short L vs ER
JeremyWS	684052945315467264	2016-01-04T16:45:05	thalesians eurgbp short fundamentally makes more sense, especialyl if oil stays weak and you have the ECB on ur side as opposed to fed
JeremyWS	684052085915172865	2016-01-04T16:41:41	JeremyWS Vols in FX spiking a bit today (1m over 8), skew roughly unch in last months. Positioning/sentiment/flow rather bearish to extreme
JeremyWS	684051721870532609	2016-01-04T16:40:14	JeremyWS not just vis a vis USD notably, but against EUR and others too. across the board seems "cheap" to rates
JeremyWS	684051583785648128	2016-01-04T16:39:41	On GBP, vs fixed dated front end spreads its about 500bps out in fx terms, spreads been rising since early Dec, FX clearly hasnt.
JeremyWS	684050506847748096	2016-01-04T16:35:24	MOstwald1 thanks, wil have a proper read of this tonight, cheers boss
JeremyWS	684049634197671936	2016-01-04T16:31:56	KenVeksler I've played from rates side thus far and its worked out okay, FX really diverged from what is still quite dovish mkt rate path
JeremyWS	684048662431952896	2016-01-04T16:28:04	GBP is a clear buy on every metric i use to analyse markets. can a bear please tell me why i shouldnt be long here?
JeremyWS	684043090571689984	2016-01-04T16:05:56	Bought some ES, as Macro_Tiger would say, for bantz. Bit excessive for day 1

JeremyWS	683818481557594112	2016-01-04T01:13:25	NZD and AUD getting rekt, so much for that dairy flow supporting it, specs are back in town

JeremyWS	682606833635295233	2015-12-31T16:58:46	CitySocialist Macro_Tiger as in, not the skew per se, just a 1 point move at 30 v different to at 50 etc
JeremyWS	682606351852384256	2015-12-31T16:56:51	CitySocialist Macro_Tiger also gotta remember vol gonna be higher at lower strikes and vice versa

JeremyWS	682358155888689152	2015-12-31T00:30:36	georgepearkes hmm i didnt do that and i had a reason why not but i cant remember why now

JeremyWS	682355279065907201	2015-12-31T00:19:10	thalesians yeh true, but even still.. pretty sure if someone wants risk in size it'll will engulf even concentrated trade flow at any time
JeremyWS	682354426586251264	2015-12-31T00:15:47	Whole purpose of that was, apparently dairy co's reason behind bid in NZ$, but given trade is less than 1/200th of the market, maybs not
