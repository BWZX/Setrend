FrankLuntz	707755396593639424	2016-03-10T02:30:10	What a difference: the Democrats wait their turn; the Republicans yell over each other.  I hope the GOP candidates are watching.  DemDebate
FrankLuntz	707754432620957697	2016-03-10T02:26:20	‚ÄúHispandering?‚Äù  This DemDebate is a language lover's dream.
FrankLuntz	707753850313134080	2016-03-10T02:24:02	These are very tough questions‚Ä¶  but there's no follow-up.  Great effort, but it's follow-up that holds candidates accountable.  DemDebate
FrankLuntz	707752866530742272	2016-03-10T02:20:07	‚ÄúYou don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great.‚Äù  Best line I've ever heard Hillary say.  DemDebate
FrankLuntz	707752711580549122	2016-03-10T02:19:30	Univision's JorgeRamos is the first journalist tough enough to ask Hillary about potential indictment.  No wonder Trump is scared of him.
FrankLuntz	707752171622649856	2016-03-10T02:17:21	Bernie missed a huge chance to pounce on Hillary‚Äôs non-answer. 
FrankLuntz	707752064982462464	2016-03-10T02:16:56	Hillary's refusal to answer the indictment question was strategically smart.  There is no good answer except no answer.  DemDebate
FrankLuntz	707751653345251330	2016-03-10T02:15:18	That's going to be Hillary's strategy in a general race against Trump ‚Äì she's positive, he's negative. 
FrankLuntz	707751463221497857	2016-03-10T02:14:32	Hillary has been coached to use the word "positive."  She's clearly focused not on Bernie but on Trump.  DemDebate
FrankLuntz	707751228462116864	2016-03-10T02:13:36	Bernie has won 9 states so far.  That‚Äôs more than any current GOP runner-up.  DemDebate
FrankLuntz	707750871333928960	2016-03-10T02:12:11	This is also why (believe it or not) Bernie gets Trump-leaning Democratic voters.  DemDebate 
FrankLuntz	707750736042438658	2016-03-10T02:11:39	Listen carefully to their words: Hillary runs against corporations. Bernie runs against the establishment.  DemDebate

FrankLuntz	707733859459211264	2016-03-10T01:04:35	In 2008, Obama won more states/territories than Hillary, (33 vs. 23) but she won 270,000+ more of the popular vote. 
FrankLuntz	707732823675789312	2016-03-10T01:00:28	Momentum:  Hillary won 17 more delegates last night, but Bernie‚Äôs Michigan win will make voters in subsequent states consider him seriously.
FrankLuntz	707725473145425924	2016-03-10T00:31:16	The media room at tonight's DemDebate.  The big question after Michigan: will Hillary and Bernie come out swinging? 
FrankLuntz	707711938612957185	2016-03-09T23:37:29	Ohio:  80% of Trump supporters say they‚Äôre set on who they‚Äôll vote for, and 75% of Kasich supporters say the same. 
FrankLuntz	707707923275776000	2016-03-09T23:21:32	Trump only had single-digit leads on Kasich in Ohio up to today.  In Florida, he leads Rubio by 20+. 
FrankLuntz	707696421646958593	2016-03-09T22:35:49	That‚Äôs assuming that Hillary Clinton wants more TV coverage. 
FrankLuntz	707672535777857537	2016-03-09T21:00:55	"The most transparent administration in U.S. history."  
FrankLuntz	707659646522236928	2016-03-09T20:09:42	FrankLuntz A voter needs to simply sign an affidavit at the polling place to switch parties.
FrankLuntz	707659344330907650	2016-03-09T20:08:30	Looks like Ohio is effectively an open primary. You can change parties at the poll by asking for a Dem/GOP ballot.  
FrankLuntz	707657340737216512	2016-03-09T20:00:32	Democratic primary numbers from 2008:   
FrankLuntz	707651553776144384	2016-03-09T19:37:32	Worth noting: Ohio and Florida are closed primaries.   
FrankLuntz	707649877728206852	2016-03-09T19:30:53	In Michigan, Hillary won Democrat voters 58% to 40% but Bernie won independents 71% to 28%.

FrankLuntz	707453086235807745	2016-03-09T06:28:54	After picking up 10 delegates from ID, (along with 25 from MI and 24 from MS) Trump has hit his 59 target tonight to stay on pace for 1,237.
FrankLuntz	707434678874202112	2016-03-09T05:15:45	Could Bernie surprise again in Florida?  Hillary is currently up +25 but was also up +21 in Michigan before tonight.
