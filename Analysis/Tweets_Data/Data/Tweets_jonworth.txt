jonworth	725960352995917824	2016-04-29T08:10:10	hughbs garethharding AdamsonPaul Point was that he complains EU doesn’t work. But does nothing with his responsibility to make it work.

jonworth	725012891154436096	2016-04-26T17:25:17	thirstygargoyle Indeed. That was more or less my point. I don’t quite know how “special” would be defined here, as there’s no precedent.

jonworth	725010812134367232	2016-04-26T17:17:02	thirstygargoyle Well EU would happily have it. As politically it’d give the EU the upper hand. Would the UK live with it? I doubt it…
jonworth	725009661280276480	2016-04-26T17:12:27	More diverse Twitter network makes you smarter  
jonworth	725010100616859648	2016-04-26T17:14:12	FPM_Paris Yeah. But if it messes with the banking industry? Some banks choose to move to Frankfurt…?
jonworth	725009503960309760	2016-04-26T17:11:50	FPM_Paris Possibly. But if UK economy takes a hit from Brexit, that might make others wonder if it’s worth attempting.
jonworth	725008726193803265	2016-04-26T17:08:44	FPM_Paris Thing is a Norway-style deal wouldn’t cause economic chaos for UK, but politically it’d be unpalatable for Brexiteers.
jonworth	725008553052917760	2016-04-26T17:08:03	FPM_Paris Yes, that I understand. And rest of EU would hold upper hand in negs with the UK anyway.
jonworth	725007967867777025	2016-04-26T17:05:44	Hasselfeldt says no special treatment for UK  But surely UK could get a Norway-style deal if it, and EU, wanted it?

jonworth	724982302569299968	2016-04-26T15:23:45	BegleyChris Ah, no. Because Berlin actually now has enough passengers to fill the airport when Tegel closes.

jonworth	715176399028494336	2016-03-30T13:58:35	Sapere_vivere And a change to tariffs could add 50% to cost of Chinese imports straight away. Massively more significant than energy cost.

jonworth	715146307757850625	2016-03-30T11:59:01	StevePeers Right. But there’s more freedom within those rules than the EU is currently using…
jonworth	715145518645657600	2016-03-30T11:55:53	kentindell oditorium Oh there’s a case for not increasing tariffs, sure! But it’s not the EU to blame as brexit folks argue.
jonworth	715145294032343040	2016-03-30T11:54:59	StevePeers Right. There are pros and cons on both sides. But the EU is not the problem here.
jonworth	715142802032758785	2016-03-30T11:45:05	StevePeers Yes, indeed. And while Farage whines about the rules, he’s of course silent on what he’d actually do if UK did control this!

jonworth	715140153925349380	2016-03-30T11:34:34	Basically not a sovereignty issue. Higher tariffs on steel could be agreed in EU *IF UK GOVT WANTED THEM*. It doesn’t. That’s the problem.
jonworth	715139238598164480	2016-03-30T11:30:55	So Nigel_Farage bashing EU on steel and tariffs, but I can find nothing where he’s said he’d favour higher tariffs, end lesser duty rule.
jonworth	715138526401150977	2016-03-30T11:28:05	Sapere_vivere Norway in EEA has to accept the state aid and tariff rules. So if it had a steel industry it’d be in same spot as Pt Talbot
jonworth	715138023768371200	2016-03-30T11:26:06	Sapere_vivere If UK were out of EU *fully* (i.e. not Norway style), WTO rules’d apply, and EU could apply tariff to UK steel exports to EU
jonworth	715137754741542912	2016-03-30T11:25:02	Sapere_vivere Right. And the EU could act to defend its industry against oversupply by ending lesser duty rule. UK opposes ending it.
jonworth	715137214703878144	2016-03-30T11:22:53	Sapere_vivere It’s QMV, so you don’t need 27 countries’ approval. And if EU slapped tariff on UK steel if UK out of EU you’d be screwed too
jonworth	715137018880212992	2016-03-30T11:22:06	Sapere_vivere Fair to say there’s an EU role on state aid and renewables. Not AFAIK fair to say this causing demise of Port Talbot.
jonworth	715136679074533376	2016-03-30T11:20:45	Sapere_vivere Sorry but on the tariff one, the EU is open to the change, but the UK isn’t. So that’s a pretty theoretical ‘power’ to use!
jonworth	715136022405898240	2016-03-30T11:18:08	Sapere_vivere Yes, but what % of the cost of a tonne is due to that? And is that still true as €/kWh for renewables dropping?

jonworth	715135041681100800	2016-03-30T11:14:15	Sapere_vivere Re. energy point - I mean more that I don’t know how high/low energy costs’d be if UK were out of EU &amp; if that’d help.
jonworth	715134874907197440	2016-03-30T11:13:35	Sapere_vivere EU state aid rules mean nationalising the thing would be complex (not impossible). I don’t know how central energy costs are
jonworth	715134561567563776	2016-03-30T11:12:20	LohmannBond The Brexit folks are making hay out of this. So govt’s decision has non-trade, non-steel consequences.
jonworth	715134193412530177	2016-03-30T11:10:52	Sapere_vivere On tariffs the UK is *stopping* the EU upping rates from about 10% to about 60%. That’s the major issue here.
jonworth	715133720110501888	2016-03-30T11:09:00	FESMontemaggi Was told on FB, earnestly, by a UK political friend: “Caring overtly makes you weird &amp; unpersuasive”. Pfff.
jonworth	715132975390785536	2016-03-30T11:06:02	FESMontemaggi But they’d never want to really even *try* - because those people would be grassroots-y, hence not to be trusted.

jonworth	707266263622492160	2016-03-08T18:06:32	Really, Cameron’s “vision” doesn’t extend beyond saving his own skin in his party. That drives whole EUref. ECFRbrexit

jonworth	707265713858351104	2016-03-08T18:04:21	mvanderKist Right. Because UK exploits its poor. While Brits crow about their economic success.
