asymco	726244515313504256	2016-04-30T02:59:20	MichaelMstehle Matching buyers with sellers is what markets do. If they can't find each other there is no economic activity.
asymco	726243646039834624	2016-04-30T02:55:52	MichaelMstehle it's also important to separate marketing from advertising. As different as engineering is from manufacturing.
asymco	726242429926531072	2016-04-30T02:51:02	MichaelMstehle This is a good question. One can view advertising as creation of value or as its destruction. I believe it's both.

asymco	716806595041079296	2016-04-04T01:56:24	jakedaywilliams The Tesla logic seems to be: everyone should drive electric and we hope to be #20 or so, if we survive.

asymco	716806111433613313	2016-04-04T01:54:29	jakedaywilliams This is where I have a disconnect: what Tesla pitches is not something I can understand as a business.
asymco	716805826808193024	2016-04-04T01:53:21	jakedaywilliams Tesla’s own goals are in a way contrary to their shareholders’. If Tesla succeeds then they are commoditized or also-rans.
asymco	716805026719539201	2016-04-04T01:50:10	jakedaywilliams Therefore I would very much prefer to be right: Car production will convert to 100 million EVs/yr as soon as possible.
