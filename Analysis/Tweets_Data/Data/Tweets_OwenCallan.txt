OwenCallan	723594485444304898	2016-04-22T19:29:03	LondonAnalyst no, we really don't. This tweet thread started with the claim on real level of potential multipliers. Lets finish that first.
OwenCallan	723594142664810496	2016-04-22T19:27:41	LondonAnalyst could be 15? Right, so run a 7.5% deficit and double GDP level in a year? This is what you are suggesting.

OwenCallan	723593371688820737	2016-04-22T19:24:38	LondonAnalyst what have assets prices got to do with this? U know diff between multiplier effect and fractional reserve banking, right??

OwenCallan	723586984917213184	2016-04-22T18:59:15	LondonAnalyst your fundamental issue is a chronic lack of knowledge of economics. Which is a problem for an economist.
OwenCallan	723586741295304704	2016-04-22T18:58:17	LondonAnalyst awesome. You have an example of an economy that has seen multiplier levels of close to 10x over a sustained period? Right?
OwenCallan	723585520169803776	2016-04-22T18:53:26	LondonAnalyst my punchline is simply that you don't seem to understand economics. It's a fairly blunt one, I'll admit.
OwenCallan	723583723015409664	2016-04-22T18:46:17	LondonAnalyst u are an economist and u think it wld pay off the debt? Pls explain how. Multiplier of 10? Is this fantasy economics?

OwenCallan	723574943875735552	2016-04-22T18:11:24	Nospin_43 AbbeyLane5 MikkiL eh, that's fractional reserve banking. Not a fiscal/economic multiplier. Entirely different things.
OwenCallan	723574752288354304	2016-04-22T18:10:38	Nospin_43 AbbeyLane5 MikkiL so complete misunderstanding of how multiplier works and how GDP interacts with debt and deficit. Idiocy. 6/6
OwenCallan	723574584285511684	2016-04-22T18:09:58	Nospin_43 AbbeyLane5 MikkiL so 10bn saving gives 6bn improvement to deficit/debt bottom line. Over 10yrs = 60bn, not 1.5trn.    5/n

OwenCallan	723574047221649409	2016-04-22T18:07:50	Nospin_43 AbbeyLane5 MikkiL and this increase in GDP generates the same increase in govt revenues??? Economic illiteracy. 3/n
