ByrneRWS	712388551929823232	2016-03-22T21:20:40	daytrend My concern is not that he'll not address things that need fixing. It's that hell freaking destroy a ton of stuff that's working OK
ByrneRWS	712387770346409984	2016-03-22T21:17:34	daytrend But I damn sure don't want my kid looking up to him. And anytime you can say that about a presidential nominee, it's  bloody shame
ByrneRWS	712387595624255488	2016-03-22T21:16:52	daytrend But from demeaning other candidates, interviewers etc. Trump will likely win the nomination.
ByrneRWS	712387202584420352	2016-03-22T21:15:19	daytrend Do you believe we should have to censor presidential candidates from our kids? Not from graphic talk on terrorism.
ByrneRWS	712387174138646528	2016-03-22T21:15:12	daytrend But frankly, I am embarrassed to let my 9 yr old daughter listen to ANY program interviewing Trump for very obvious reasons.
ByrneRWS	712387146326220804	2016-03-22T21:15:05	daytrend Run out of time in a caucus environment...absolutely. For the general election, of course not.
ByrneRWS	712386587644956672	2016-03-22T21:12:52	Really MelissaLeeCNBC ... NKE is tumbling? I suppose the lack of down-ticks in this market has skewed us.
ByrneRWS	712386279078367232	2016-03-22T21:11:39	daytrend one speech, no matter how well written (likely by others), is insufficient to convince me he's presidential material.
ByrneRWS	712386257230241795	2016-03-22T21:11:33	daytrend Trump can give a nice, prepared, speech. But given his inability to act in a civil manner...
ByrneRWS	712385891063304193	2016-03-22T21:10:06	daytrend I'll give it a watch. But I tend to believe one's opinion of who should run the country should be developed over significant time.
ByrneRWS	712384956228472832	2016-03-22T21:06:23	daytrend In a nutshell, I hate my options. A petty complaint to some, I suppose, but it's how I view things right now.
ByrneRWS	712384945805627392	2016-03-22T21:06:21	daytrend at winning, but I also do not support giving him the nomination in an open convention if others have earned more Delegates.
ByrneRWS	712384921466118144	2016-03-22T21:06:15	daytrend And as someone that simply lacks the skill, personality and general demeanor to be President. I truly wish Kasich had a shot
ByrneRWS	712384883218210816	2016-03-22T21:06:06	daytrend As for Trump, I don't disparage those that support him, but I simply can not do it. I view him as a protectionist.
ByrneRWS	712384855963602944	2016-03-22T21:05:59	daytrend except for the fact that he'd likely do sufficient damage to allow real estate investors to pick up property on the cheap.
ByrneRWS	712384831422750720	2016-03-22T21:05:53	daytrend The bottom line, for me, is I truly can not stand HRC and Cruz. Bernie would be horrific for the future of this country...
ByrneRWS	712381984106876929	2016-03-22T20:54:35	I feel like I'm be asked whether I'd prefer to be punched in the face or hit with a metal pipe. Are you voting for wing nut A, B or C?
