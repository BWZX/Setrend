lehmannchris	703280495191302144	2016-02-26T18:08:31	So, yeah, Rubio, that's the thing: Trump doesn't punch other people in the face--he hires Chris Christie to do it for him.
lehmannchris	703276707525083136	2016-02-26T17:53:27	If we start out asking which candidate's best to have a beer with, of c. we end up with a face-punching contest.

lehmannchris	703060664743534593	2016-02-26T03:34:59	The times when I feel the guiltiest twinge of Trump sympathy is when he derides Cruz's sleaze.
lehmannchris	703060111963639809	2016-02-26T03:32:47	North Korea, Syria, Ukraine: there's no place Kasich doesn't want to invade
lehmannchris	703058882055184385	2016-02-26T03:27:54	Wrap your head around that: George HW Bush watching from the audience as Trump suggests we'd be better off with Saddam in power in Baghdad.
lehmannchris	703057603002306561	2016-02-26T03:22:49	Wait, Carson thinks Israel is our child? Is he putting fruit salad in its lunch?
lehmannchris	703055629380927488	2016-02-26T03:14:58	So rejecting the Likud position is now "anti-Israel" according to Rubio+Cruz.  That's funny because no mainstreamer in Israel thinks that.

lehmannchris	703049491226730497	2016-02-26T02:50:35	Wolf Blitzer is so unfamiliar with the concept of asking follow-ups until there's a real answer that he won't even let other people do it.

lehmannchris	703037594326704129	2016-02-26T02:03:18	Trump as public shamer of others is not a good look
lehmannchris	703035979335135232	2016-02-26T01:56:53	All candidates vow to redeem American Dream, but wasn't immigration rather central to said dream?
