OptionScientist	718167186142048260	2016-04-07T20:02:54	OptionScientist Temperature above zero marks a Bull market except in a Bear market which requires +125 to verify return of a bullish trend.
OptionScientist	718166715092348929	2016-04-07T20:01:02	The +125 Temperature is the dividing line between Bull and Bear, which could explain the battle here. 
OptionScientist	717427148559159296	2016-04-05T19:02:16	If S&amp;P 500 can maintain a Temperature above +125 for a week or so, it shows the Bulls have re-gained their strength. 
OptionScientist	715914824627171328	2016-04-01T14:52:49	Can you "feel" the brick wall in front of you at +125 ?

OptionScientist	715611608945463296	2016-03-31T18:47:57	FrankRaneri To sum it up, after several months of a downtrend, it gets easier for the Temperature to increase to +125 and to do so quickly.
OptionScientist	715610678221008897	2016-03-31T18:44:15	FrankRaneri Orange line is declining, representing lower expectations from traders,thus easier to beat expectations 
OptionScientist	715608929401716736	2016-03-31T18:37:18	FrankRaneri Yes. Whereas SPX crossing above the 200sma tends to happen at a small angle, SPX approaching +125 (orange line) can be steep.
OptionScientist	715205991323852801	2016-03-30T15:56:10	OptionScientist Because it's an approximation, +125 does not magically mark the end of Bear Market Stage 7. Sustained values ABOVE +125 do.
OptionScientist	715205550770925568	2016-03-30T15:54:25	Important to note +125 is an APPROXIMATION of point where this week's expiring 4-month ATM Long Calls are profitable

OptionScientist	712016313867173888	2016-03-21T20:41:32	chewy8286 Exact number is SPX from Nov. 23 (2090) + Nov 23 ATM Call premium (70) = 2160. Temperature of +125 is a quick approximation.
OptionScientist	712015749410373633	2016-03-21T20:39:17	chewy8286 Approximately. You are correct. Actual spot where 4-month ATM SPY Long Calls expire with profit this week is currently SPX 2160

OptionScientist	707234925074722816	2016-03-08T16:02:00	Sub-zero Temperatures continue. Bear Market Stage 7 continues as well. 
OptionScientist	707234442415181824	2016-03-08T16:00:05	JDivina666 Likely some profit-taking bringing the Temperature down today, as is expected since Bear Market Stage 7 is a sell-the-rip stage.

OptionScientist	704791499490369538	2016-03-01T22:12:42	Normally it takes a Temperature of +125 or more to escape the orange zone and verify return of the Bull market trend

OptionScientist	697784138695180289	2016-02-11T14:07:57	acestock Declines are common in Stage 8. Support levels are only illusions. Temperature reached -400 in 2008 crisis.

OptionScientist	693914120177999872	2016-01-31T21:49:53	chewy8286 It's neat how 1966 coincides with major SPX support, to me anyway, since the two are totally independent. Happens quite often.
OptionScientist	693906334593499136	2016-01-31T21:18:56	stockroads You are correct, after Fri. expiry I use next week's expiry to calculate Temp. Keeps me from tampering with it during the week.
OptionScientist	693905499239124992	2016-01-31T21:15:37	chewy8286 S&amp;P:500 Temperature always is referenced to B/E that particular week's expiring Covered Calls opened 16 weeks (4 months) earlier.
OptionScientist	693904658377629696	2016-01-31T21:12:17	chewy8286 Good question. Go back 16 weeks from this Friday. Oct. 16. SPX was 2033 &amp; ATM Call premium was 67. Covered Call breakeven 1966.
OptionScientist	693903450325794816	2016-01-31T21:07:29	apieceofschmidt Now that you mention it, SPX 1966 has been an important support since August, verified in Sep and this Jan. Coincidence?

OptionScientist	692014215947751425	2016-01-26T16:00:20	dis077 Question is - when is a Bear market ready to turn back into a Bull? For me it's Bear Market Stage 9, which I have not seen... yet.
OptionScientist	692005936291024896	2016-01-26T15:27:26	At Temperatures like this, permafrost could become a problem for the Bulls. 
OptionScientist	691724464715886593	2016-01-25T20:48:58	I put this guide together a few weeks ago in anticipation of Bear Market Stage 7. 
OptionScientist	691723446871592961	2016-01-25T20:44:55	acestock Bear Market Stage 7 usually contains the most severe sell-off of a Bear Market. It correlates with a widespread loss of hope.
OptionScientist	691722717243011072	2016-01-25T20:42:02	It generally requires a few days to verify, but this certainly looks like the beginning of Bear Market Stage 7. 
OptionScientist	691718836710670336	2016-01-25T20:26:36	Sub-zero Temperature suggests Bear Market Stage 7 has taken hold.

OptionScientist	687653034533490688	2016-01-14T15:10:34	Still a healthy buffer (49 points) until Bear Market Stage 7, but it's getting narrower.

OptionScientist	685050591140253696	2016-01-07T10:49:23	Estimated Temperature based upon overnight /ES futures. 
OptionScientist	684746103745581056	2016-01-06T14:39:27	Bear Market Stage 6 continues. 
OptionScientist	684745979589988353	2016-01-06T14:38:58	Bear Market Stage 7 probably would have begun long ago, if not for the Temperature being so hot. 
OptionScientist	683928765844570112	2016-01-04T08:31:39	Opening S&amp;P 500 Temperature of 2016 estimated from current pre-market /ES futures. 
OptionScientist	682675083656167425	2015-12-31T21:29:58	Bear Market Stage 6, not a great way to end 2015, but... it's an ending. 
OptionScientist	682672166190608386	2015-12-31T21:18:22	And... 2015 ends INSIDE the limits of Bear Market Stage 6, with about 20 points to spare. 
OptionScientist	682267400583168000	2015-12-30T18:29:58	S&amp;P 500 Temperature getting too high? Try these. 
OptionScientist	682042745565908992	2015-12-30T03:37:16	metasyntrading Basically, Covered Calls ($SPY ATM 16 week) only expire at a loss in a true Bear market (when the Temperature is below zero)
OptionScientist	682042251564965888	2015-12-30T03:35:19	metasyntrading Temp 0 is the break-even point for this week's expiring SPY Covered Call options that were opened At The Money 16 weeks ago
OptionScientist	682030655501414400	2015-12-30T02:49:14	metasyntrading Only exception to above zero being Bullish is during Bear Market Stage 6.
OptionScientist	682030500458967040	2015-12-30T02:48:37	metasyntrading Here's 10-year Temp history. Above 250 is quite rare and unsustainable,above zero generally Bullish. 
OptionScientist	681968707166433280	2015-12-29T22:43:04	Options Market Stages now favor the Bulls, but only if they can SUSTAIN these levels for the S&amp;P 500. 
OptionScientist	681967849770987520	2015-12-29T22:39:40	Temperatures above 250 are rare and unsustainable - that's BAD for the Bulls if they want SUSTAINABILITY.

OptionScientist	681538356375851010	2015-12-28T18:13:01	Missed last weekend's SPECIAL REPORT ? LSSI Suggests Action-Packed Start to 2016 is at ==&gt;  
OptionScientist	681537216590528512	2015-12-28T18:08:29	Yes, it's warm in New York, but it's still winter, and it's still Bear Market Stage 6. 
OptionScientist	681536559254999040	2015-12-28T18:05:52	WilliamGambill Can't seem to break out of Stage 6. The longer Stage 6 lasts the more discouraged the Bulls will become, in my opinion.
OptionScientist	681156502325964800	2015-12-27T16:55:40	Thanks for the RT FridaSizelove re: LSSI Suggests Action-Packed Start to 2016 
OptionScientist	681156162830598146	2015-12-27T16:54:19	acestock Poor performance on expiring SPY ATM 4-month Long Straddles and Long Strangles often precedes a major breakout in the S&amp;P 500.

OptionScientist	679732857737199617	2015-12-23T18:38:36	UCCat1 I'm selling SPY Naked Calls. If we break into the black 4 more than a week, I'll buy SPY shares and convert them to Covered Calls.
OptionScientist	679728027530563588	2015-12-23T18:19:25	scott_minnesota Yes, easy to push higher when half of U.S. traders are at the mall buying gifts.
OptionScientist	679727642472509441	2015-12-23T18:17:53	DowdEdward I see it as a CHOICE for those with sufficient sway, rather than ODDS. Seems like a bad CHOICE to restart here, but that's me.
OptionScientist	679725417075466240	2015-12-23T18:09:02	Could be a record high temperature for a Bear market, or it could mark the resumption of a Bull market, we'll see. 
OptionScientist	679724690483580928	2015-12-23T18:06:09	This is it folks - this is about as high as the S&amp;P can go without triggering a return of the Bull market uptrend.
