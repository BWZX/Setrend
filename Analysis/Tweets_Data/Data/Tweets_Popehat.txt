Popehat	723298246777442304	2016-04-21T23:51:54	.wahrbear Right. Saying that the 1st Amendment doesn't regulate private employment is "attacking freedom of expression." Got it.
Popehat	723297814676021248	2016-04-21T23:50:11	.wahrbear Does he communicate with you in other ways? Like if he wears a blue tie, is that EVERYBODY MUST GAY MARRY NOW FOR OBAMA?
Popehat	723297687404081152	2016-04-21T23:49:41	.wahrbear So we are back to square one: stating the law correctly is a personal attack on you?
Popehat	723296976108810240	2016-04-21T23:46:51	.wahrbear anaaronfreeman So, because he used a trending hashtag, he was directly attacking you, a complete stranger? I . . . see.
Popehat	723295197648416768	2016-04-21T23:39:47	wahrbear No. You said he changed the subject. And you attacked a tweet that didn't say anything about "freedom of expression."
Popehat	723293957346611200	2016-04-21T23:34:52	wahrbear Well, you're the one who thinks that a stranger who wasn't talking to you "changed the subject."
Popehat	723293230138167296	2016-04-21T23:31:58	.wahrbear You understand that he wasn't talking to you right? That you got enraged he changed the subject that was in your head?
Popehat	723293003977121792	2016-04-21T23:31:04	.wahrbear A law prof mentioned the law talking about a legal issue? That SJW bastard.
Popehat	723292171399401473	2016-04-21T23:27:46	.wahrbear No, my goal is to use you as a strawman for all SJWList fans even though fairness suggests most aren't that dim.
Popehat	723291777663262720	2016-04-21T23:26:12	.wahrbear No I mean it.  You couldn't be more inadequate as a shitlord if you had a Garfield avi.

Popehat	723290786125606916	2016-04-21T23:22:16	.wahrbear Also: do I have to be right about the First Amendment to get on there? Can I get on by being right about, say, ERISA?
Popehat	723290616818331648	2016-04-21T23:21:35	.wahrbear Also: would you say deliberate ignorance of basic American civics is a key value, core value, or essential value of SJWList?
Popehat	723290431404953600	2016-04-21T23:20:51	.wahrbear OK. So would you say your goal is to prevent accurate statements of law and promote ignorance of law? I like your chances.
Popehat	723290223455559681	2016-04-21T23:20:02	Popehat In that context yes. A man was fired for his off-clock politics. If this was a feminist fired for feminism there'd be a shitfit.
Popehat	723289940386152448	2016-04-21T23:18:54	.wahrbear So, again:  accurately stating the law is being an apologist?

Popehat	723287935462694912	2016-04-21T23:10:56	.wahrbear "The subject." You were in a discussion with the law professor? Can others hear it? Did he speak to you through your TV?
Popehat	723287671888465921	2016-04-21T23:09:53	.wahrbear So basically, you think that observing that something is not illegal is the same as saying it is praiseworthy?
Popehat	723287319323635712	2016-04-21T23:08:29	.wahrbear A discussion? It looked to me like you flipped out and asked that a law professor be put on an enemies list for discussing law.
Popehat	723286655642165252	2016-04-21T23:05:51	EsotericCD It's the backswing over the shoulder that makes it.
Popehat	723286340817702912	2016-04-21T23:04:36	.wahrbear So, basically, you're upset because even if it was a correct statement of law it made you feel bad?  I got you bro.  I got you.
Popehat	723285754856665088	2016-04-21T23:02:16	.wahrbear So, to not be gaslighting, I would have to assert (wrongly) that the First Amendment governs private employment relationships?
Popehat	723284768134037504	2016-04-21T22:58:21	wahrbear Is gaslighting the same as ridiculing? I'm ridiculing you for wanting to put people on lists for correct statements of law.

Popehat	719866368863014916	2016-04-12T12:34:51	thewargarurumon Well, you're the expert on argument. No doubt you'll explain it more to your inferiors.
Popehat	719865489103532032	2016-04-12T12:31:21	thewargarurumon Not saying you are stupid. Saying that not listening to someone doesn't silence them. No right to be listened to.
Popehat	719865216507379715	2016-04-12T12:30:16	thewargarurumon  I see. So your "argument" is to keep repeating it. This is what I'd miss with a blocklist?
Popehat	719863737776103425	2016-04-12T12:24:24	thewargarurumon KilgoreSprout DrunkenKarnie You keep saying "silence." Doesn't make it true.

Popehat	719731676960534528	2016-04-12T03:39:38	PainfulBinder thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie then the problem is the people in power.
Popehat	719731285824933889	2016-04-12T03:38:05	thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie yes. Which you are trying, and failing, to convince us is silencing.

Popehat	719730328235958275	2016-04-12T03:34:16	thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie We are still talking about Twitter block lists, right?
Popehat	719729445049765889	2016-04-12T03:30:46	thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie how does an opt-in Twitter block list shun you from society?
Popehat	719729140954324992	2016-04-12T03:29:33	thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie then the behavior of the person with power is the issue, not the free speech and association of others.

Popehat	719728333244604417	2016-04-12T03:26:21	thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie you lose me with "effectively silence." You're begging the question.
Popehat	719728044353523712	2016-04-12T03:25:12	PainfulBinder JoGoDant no, actually.  The legal standard is fairly clear.
Popehat	719727942276763648	2016-04-12T03:24:47	thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie Why do you care about the opinion of someone who believes you are bad because you are on an arbitrary list?
Popehat	719727539992666112	2016-04-12T03:23:12	thewargarurumon DrunkenKarnie Yes, free expression and free association can be used to stigmatize. And?
Popehat	719727244822732800	2016-04-12T03:22:01	PainfulBinder JoGoDant the system shouldn't protect anyone from being "silenced" by speech. (Leaving aide true threats)

Popehat	719717482328555524	2016-04-12T02:43:14	.JoGoDant I'm not sure we can, or should, create a system to protect people who can be shocked into silence by being called a name.
Popehat	719717236366315520	2016-04-12T02:42:15	Popehat Some of us can, but the incident that made me set up this experiment shocked other people into silence.
Popehat	719716840641994752	2016-04-12T02:40:41	JoGoDant Fortunately I'm not a huge girl's blouse so I can keep talking even after an idiot says something stupid about me.

Popehat	719716328765059072	2016-04-12T02:38:39	Popehat so i guess you think this  doesn't exist
Popehat	719716282057097216	2016-04-12T02:38:27	thewargarurumon Because it's a waste of time, and my entire point is I'm not obligated to waste my time because you think I should?
Popehat	719716007409876994	2016-04-12T02:37:22	thewargarurumon pssst blacklists would be libel because they are written unless you are muttering to yourself

Popehat	719715462540492800	2016-04-12T02:35:12	thewargarurumon What would be the utility of engaging in that discussion with my ilk?
Popehat	719715223582605313	2016-04-12T02:34:15	AvrahamAdler Quite. And if you think blocklists are irrational, why do you need irrational people to hear you out?

Popehat	719714378103128064	2016-04-12T02:30:54	JoGoDant What I'm saying is that "calling me a racist shuts down debate" is the same as "your racist speech shuts down debate."
Popehat	719714006852710402	2016-04-12T02:29:25	thewargarurumon The problem isn't that you don't know what you're talking about. The problem is you think I should still listen anyway.
Popehat	719713669253189632	2016-04-12T02:28:05	JoGoDant Also, "your speech silences me" is, embarrassingly, increasingly frequent on both sides.
Popehat	719713560671035393	2016-04-12T02:27:39	JoGoDant Well, since you stepped into a talk about blocklists, I assumed you were also talking about them.
Popehat	719713279694675969	2016-04-12T02:26:32	thewargarurumon AvrahamAdler jake_the4th Again, this is what I would miss with a blocklist?
Popehat	719712845571629056	2016-04-12T02:24:48	JoGoDant Getting a debate cancelled is shutting it down. Choosing not to go to someone else's debate is not.
Popehat	719712088508137472	2016-04-12T02:21:48	JoGoDant OK. It's important to you that people you think are unfair, shallow idiots should listen to you?

Popehat	719711486625468416	2016-04-12T02:19:24	PainfulBinder I'm not fighting to draw the line for other people. I'm fighting for everyone's right to draw it for themselves.
Popehat	719711249555021824	2016-04-12T02:18:28	PainfulBinder Who do you care who someone else listens to?
Popehat	719711078066704385	2016-04-12T02:17:47	Dont_be_a_dweeb sid_bark You think getting the most is the same as getting a majority?
Popehat	719710830871187456	2016-04-12T02:16:48	jake_the4th No, apparently there's a free-floating right to be heard and not to be defamed by being put on a list, or something
Popehat	719710615443378176	2016-04-12T02:15:56	Dont_be_a_dweeb sid_bark i don't think majority means what you think it means
Popehat	719710105030144000	2016-04-12T02:13:55	PainfulBinder I don't find it to be. I listen to who I feel like listening to.
Popehat	719709643581206528	2016-04-12T02:12:05	JoGoDant "This speech is right, that speech is wrong." Kind of sounds the same on both sides.

Popehat	719709168995700736	2016-04-12T02:10:12	PainfulBinder I like social media because it allows me freedom of association. Some people find that freedom objectionable.
Popehat	719708405833699328	2016-04-12T02:07:10	JoGoDant And your criteria on the difference are the only objectively true and correct criteria.

Popehat	719706690107518977	2016-04-12T02:00:21	JoGoDant Somehow I thought not. Are they dialectical?  I hear that a lot.
Popehat	719706588366430208	2016-04-12T01:59:56	MZHemingway RadioFreeTom Bah. Syntaxical.
Popehat	719706582078988289	2016-04-12T01:59:55	marilynmaupin That's the approach we take. Given what we see, I don't begrudge other approaches, even if I don't follow them.

Popehat	719706398750158849	2016-04-12T01:59:11	PainfulBinder JoGoDant thewargarurumon khymchanur Is it more or less cruel than not listening to you?

Popehat	719705924596682753	2016-04-12T01:57:18	JoGoDant OK. So reasonable labels/insults are not silencing but unfair ones, as determined by target, are silencing. Perfectly principled.
Popehat	719705648791818240	2016-04-12T01:56:12	PainfulBinder JoGoDant thewargarurumon khymchanur I see. They wouldn't pile on if the person blocked you and didn't tweet at you, right?

Popehat	719705071324258305	2016-04-12T01:53:55	thewargarurumon khymchanur what is "radical free-speech"?
Popehat	719704989573128194	2016-04-12T01:53:35	thewargarurumon khymchanur So your concern is an employer smart enough to check the profile but too stupid to know the list's arbitrary?
Popehat	719704439834017792	2016-04-12T01:51:24	thewargarurumon khymchanur So, again, you're equating not listening to preventing others from listening?
Popehat	719704280765112320	2016-04-12T01:50:46	JoGoDant thewargarurumon khymchanur So is there a list of things which, if you are called them, are "silencing"?
Popehat	719704043099033601	2016-04-12T01:49:49	thewargarurumon khymchanur It's the right not to be offended, right? The right to be free of hate speech?
Popehat	719703904359833600	2016-04-12T01:49:16	thewargarurumon khymchanur I know, if I don't get called cuck at least 12 times a day I may not fully understand the argument
Popehat	719703697379303424	2016-04-12T01:48:27	Roran_Stehl First would cover via freedom of association, etc.
Popehat	719703360538947584	2016-04-12T01:47:07	.thewargarurumon khymchanur So being called names is being silenced?  I think I've heard this before from Oberlin students.
Popehat	719703116187181056	2016-04-12T01:46:08	thewargarurumon khymchanur So people make stupid assumptions based on an arbitrary list, and it's essential you talk to these people?
Popehat	719702813480083456	2016-04-12T01:44:56	Roran_Stehl You mean what amendment covers freedom of association?  That would be the First.

Popehat	719701914242433024	2016-04-12T01:41:22	Popehat if you really break down the sentiment of this tweet that is why. Lawyers are playing with cheat codes and being smug about winning

Popehat	719701165458337792	2016-04-12T01:38:23	thewargarurumon khymchanur So people are not listening based on guilt by association. How does that silence the speakers?
Popehat	719701159838097408	2016-04-12T01:38:22	Pssst. Nobody tell Trump that the presidential election is decided by an electoral college.  Let's keep that our secret. You and me.
