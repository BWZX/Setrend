IRON100	334337771844014081	2013-05-14T16:01:51	craigbrockie The blog will return at some point again.
IRON100	334337712939220992	2013-05-14T16:01:37	craigbrockie Thank you sir. I do. I am at a remote location, so I am using the password compromised IRON100 account. Give me more time.
IRON100	195289460659855360	2012-04-25T23:13:30	Urbane_Gorilla I'd rather wear out than rust out :)
IRON100	194963887483916289	2012-04-25T01:39:47	Urbane_Gorilla I have three businesses (killed the fourth just recently), and I really do not have as much time to post on Twitter.
IRON100	194963686815842304	2012-04-25T01:38:59	Urbane_Gorilla Trying to monetize what I am doing. I am in Salt Lake City this week getting some training on how to do internet mrktg.

IRON100	124285124593451008	2011-10-13T00:47:37	nedgraham Trying to lol. Need to maximize revenue and minimize spinning wheels :)
IRON100	124284969160945664	2011-10-13T00:47:00	LilPecan I find it incredibly easy to maintain scalp color without dyes lol.
IRON100	124284300253331457	2011-10-13T00:44:20	nedgraham Long way to go before I turn anything back on just yet.
IRON100	124284183437774848	2011-10-13T00:43:53	nedgraham I am working on partially reviving the daily stuff up to a point. Part may become pay (to keep the blog running w,good servers).
IRON100	124283590870700032	2011-10-13T00:41:31	moochi1 That's rough. We have been blessed this year with a "normal" fall. We are even getting rain which is nice too. We have been dry.
IRON100	124283306882760705	2011-10-13T00:40:24	iuubob I kind of abandoned stocktwits after the blog collapsed. No support, so I had to move on :).
IRON100	124283092880990208	2011-10-13T00:39:33	nedgraham Trying 2 get more done in less time. Had to abandon  couple of biz proj. because of time. Looks like SMS project will bear fruit.
IRON100	124282715079061505	2011-10-13T00:38:02	iuubob Thanks :). Wish we had that core group back together like a couple of years ago.
IRON100	124282506521489408	2011-10-13T00:37:13	moochi1 I am so happy that it has finally cooled down here. We will hit 80 tomorrow, then back to the low 70s for the duration of wknd.
IRON100	124282328183873536	2011-10-13T00:36:30	nedgraham I was going to post some items in blog with regard to SPX. Will wait till weekend to see full extent of things.
