prchovanec	714922425448796161	2016-03-29T21:09:23	peterfraserbris depthdynamics but again, I don't think that's what the data is showing.
prchovanec	714922295228284928	2016-03-29T21:08:52	peterfraserbris depthdynamics what you're describing is a shift in the composition of national savings towards households.
prchovanec	714922048989110273	2016-03-29T21:07:53	peterfraserbris depthdynamics I could see how increases in non-household credit could raise household savings. But not what's happening.
prchovanec	714921837487108098	2016-03-29T21:07:03	peterfraserbris depthdynamics anyway, those are non-household sources of credit, and I'm talking impact of consumer credit on net savings
prchovanec	714921486444789764	2016-03-29T21:05:39	peterfraserbris depthdynamics and despite QE, U.S. has not seen an explosion in credit (or M2) in recent years.
prchovanec	714921091844743168	2016-03-29T21:04:05	peterfraserbris depthdynamics but U.S. federal budget deficit has been falling in recent years, in absolute terms and % of GDP.
prchovanec	714920603866816512	2016-03-29T21:02:09	peterfraserbris depthdynamics conceptually I suppose that's possible but I don't think it matches US data in recent years.
prchovanec	714919252164272129	2016-03-29T20:56:46	peterfraserbris depthdynamics please elaborate
prchovanec	714913479577235456	2016-03-29T20:33:50	depthdynamics but still, if consumer credit rising faster than disposable income, implies falling savings rate, no?

prchovanec	714895140536651780	2016-03-29T19:20:58	LTCM_1998 BenLeubsdorf also, federal budget deficit has been falling for several years (though it is expected to start rising again)

prchovanec	714889996264669184	2016-03-29T19:00:31	depthdynamics or do you think the savings rate is not, in fact, rising? And how to reconcile that with other data?
prchovanec	714889758921588736	2016-03-29T18:59:35	depthdynamics and if ceteris isn't paribus, what piece is missing that reconciles the two?

prchovanec	712992738225033219	2016-03-24T13:21:30	Wolf_InTheWilds but clearly CA can be positive and KA negative, BoP balanced without any increase to R.
prchovanec	712992331125882880	2016-03-24T13:19:53	Wolf_InTheWilds FX reserves purchases merely remove one of the mechanisms that might tend to correct the condition.
prchovanec	712991873921654785	2016-03-24T13:18:04	Wolf_InTheWilds Country A can finance a trade surplus with Country B without any FX intervention or reserve accumulation.
prchovanec	712991611131658240	2016-03-24T13:17:01	Wolf_InTheWilds you're confusing official reserve accumulation (intervention) with the balance of payments. They aren't the same.
prchovanec	712988986772496384	2016-03-24T13:06:35	Wolf_InTheWilds that's merely an incendiary and unhelpful statement unless you elaborate exactly what harm the policy did.
prchovanec	712988556780838912	2016-03-24T13:04:53	Wolf_InTheWilds to the contrary, the rebalancing of large unsustainable imbalances is positive for everyone, though challenging for all.
prchovanec	712988221714612230	2016-03-24T13:03:33	Wolf_InTheWilds I don't think that is *in any way* a beggar-thy-neighbor viewpoint.
prchovanec	712988013303885824	2016-03-24T13:02:43	Wolf_InTheWilds as for "currency war", USD should have depreciated after GFC, and China should not have fought it.
prchovanec	712987456971415553	2016-03-24T13:00:31	Wolf_InTheWilds most of the money injected in QE2/3 never circulated, which is problematic, but not in the way you're imagining.
prchovanec	712987262728937472	2016-03-24T12:59:44	Wolf_InTheWilds purpose of QE2/3 was to reflate US demand via asset prices, which I think it largely failed in doing.
prchovanec	712987097557311488	2016-03-24T12:59:05	Wolf_InTheWilds purpose of QE1 was to serves as lender of last resort amid strong liquidity demand, which it did.
prchovanec	712986738273202176	2016-03-24T12:57:39	Wolf_InTheWilds calling a policy "currency war" is both vague and prejudicial. Say what you mean, precisely.
prchovanec	712986399394426881	2016-03-24T12:56:18	Manish_05Singh Wolf_InTheWilds as for "China bashing" I'm really not interested in bashing "China" but policies I see as counterproductive

prchovanec	712985821025009664	2016-03-24T12:54:01	Manish_05Singh Wolf_InTheWilds lesson of Plaza is not that Yen shouldn't have risen, but Japan failed to adjust to stronger Yen.
prchovanec	712985596315189248	2016-03-24T12:53:07	Manish_05Singh Wolf_InTheWilds of course, Plaza Accord shows exchange rate is not sufficient for rebalancing in face of other obstacles.
prchovanec	712985351304966147	2016-03-24T12:52:09	Manish_05Singh Wolf_InTheWilds I give China at least partial credit for allowing some RMB appreciation.
prchovanec	712985218957840386	2016-03-24T12:51:37	Manish_05Singh Wolf_InTheWilds RMB did appreciate, less and slower than it would have if China had not accumulated $4 trillion reserves.
prchovanec	712972887397961729	2016-03-24T12:02:37	Wolf_InTheWilds for all its flaws, Fed QE was not at odds with global rebalancing. China's $4 trillion currency intervention was.
prchovanec	712972443770556416	2016-03-24T12:00:51	Wolf_InTheWilds China was under no obligation to "import" Fed QE, in fact it should not have and US argued it shouldn't.
prchovanec	712972120477843456	2016-03-24T11:59:34	Wolf_InTheWilds so Fed kept RMB artificially low against USD? I don't think so?
prchovanec	712971836280143872	2016-03-24T11:58:26	Wolf_InTheWilds regardless of QE (which should have weakened USD) China chose not to allow RMB to appreciate.

prchovanec	712970932680335360	2016-03-24T11:54:51	Wolf_InTheWilds but it only takes on party to intervene in currency markets, or unwind that intervention.

prchovanec	712066132241465344	2016-03-21T23:59:30	domhewing because you acted like it was a crazy idea Putin might make Estonia a target (or invasion, or just intimidation).

prchovanec	712056845628743681	2016-03-21T23:22:36	domhewing 
prchovanec	712056145729495041	2016-03-21T23:19:49	domhewing the main obstacle, however, is that the Baltic States, unlike Ukraine, are NATO members.
prchovanec	712055799695200256	2016-03-21T23:18:26	domhewing quite high, it's the next target after Ukraine, as evidenced by several incidents.
prchovanec	712052295761076224	2016-03-21T23:04:31	BTW, part of US policy is that we don't actually WANT Japan to fend for its own security, i.e., go nuclear. Not good for anyone.

prchovanec	710279032210903040	2016-03-17T01:38:12	Haffner's point - so easily forgotten - is that in 1932, Hitler wasn't "Hitler" (i.e. so obviously the devil incarnate) as we see him today.
prchovanec	710278638411902978	2016-03-17T01:36:38	Haffner makes key point that by looking back on Hitler with 20/20 hindsight obscures much more than it reveals about meaning of his rise.

prchovanec	710240721228472320	2016-03-16T23:05:58	doktorbuzzo so I suspect that the two sides here are talking past one another, based on very different starting assumptions.
prchovanec	710240005784997888	2016-03-16T23:03:07	doktorbuzzo but after the Holocaust, the idea of a Jewish state became identified with the very idea of survival and self-preservation.
prchovanec	710239590074982400	2016-03-16T23:01:28	doktorbuzzo and of course around the time of Herzl, many Jews were deeply skeptical of Zionism ...
prchovanec	710239248402784256	2016-03-16T23:00:07	doktorbuzzo of course, I always asked him where that left anti-Zionist Orthodox Jews, but ...
prchovanec	710238893032001538	2016-03-16T22:58:42	doktorbuzzo that difference in perception forms the backdrop to this entire thing.
prchovanec	710238574109708293	2016-03-16T22:57:26	doktorbuzzo I saw a distinction (without embracing anti-Zionism in any way), he did not.

prchovanec	710235165767897093	2016-03-16T22:43:53	doktorbuzzo deep_beige are they banning attempts to silence people as "Zionists" (as we've seen recently) or banning criticism of Israel?
prchovanec	710234801282932736	2016-03-16T22:42:26	doktorbuzzo deep_beige all I have is a headline to go on. What does it mean, in practice?

prchovanec	709245674160844800	2016-03-14T05:12:00	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein I can only say that I lived in that party, and would leave this one. I see a huge difference.

prchovanec	709237605829840896	2016-03-14T04:39:56	Grizzly_Stats delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein I certainly don't believe the same of Democrats, even when I strongly disagree.

prchovanec	709236930144296960	2016-03-14T04:37:15	Grizzly_Stats delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein my experience tonight has been to try to shed some nuanced light on a past episode ...
prchovanec	709236483018850304	2016-03-14T04:35:29	Grizzly_Stats delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein that parody of Opposition is as much why we are here today, with Trump, as anything.
prchovanec	709236130974179329	2016-03-14T04:34:05	Grizzly_Stats delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein we have no moral code, except perhaps villainy.
prchovanec	709235893224214528	2016-03-14T04:33:08	Grizzly_Stats delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein exactly, we're Orcs. We don't think and feel like you do. Everything we do and are is base.
prchovanec	709234913967513600	2016-03-14T04:29:15	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein nah, you see Republicans as an Orc army. We just don't have morals like you do.
prchovanec	709233467213672448	2016-03-14T04:23:30	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein you guys really see no redeeming value in the Opposition. After a decade in China, I do.
prchovanec	709232991860609024	2016-03-14T04:21:36	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein the social violence taking place right now? I haven't conceded a connection.
prchovanec	709232805889384448	2016-03-14T04:20:52	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein all leaders-of-the-moment are imperfect. Do you really define yourself by everything Bill Clinton ever did?
prchovanec	709232494965612545	2016-03-14T04:19:38	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein yeah, tell that to a generation of GOP candidates accused of wanting to kill granny.
prchovanec	709232283757182977	2016-03-14T04:18:48	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein so why do so many conservatives (NR, etc) recoil so vehemently from Trumpism? I certainly feel revulsion.
prchovanec	709231685389426688	2016-03-14T04:16:25	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein whether that low ball truly defines that side's "best argument" is open to debate.
prchovanec	709231301786787841	2016-03-14T04:14:53	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein there is always a low-ball approach to argument available to either Right or Left.
prchovanec	709231082932146177	2016-03-14T04:14:01	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein because people are complicated and can entertain conflicting ideas in their heads simultaneously.
prchovanec	709230849204604928	2016-03-14T04:13:05	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein people convinced of something in one election cycle alter their minds in the next.
prchovanec	709230684699807744	2016-03-14T04:12:26	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein look at 2006-2008-2010. Political pendulum swings, a lot.
prchovanec	709230549462859777	2016-03-14T04:11:54	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein times change, feelings evolve, in politics even 2 years can alter the landscape a great deal.
prchovanec	709230137573822464	2016-03-14T04:10:16	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein and with all due respect, truly, he knows a great deal but wasn't *always* in the room.
prchovanec	709229844651966464	2016-03-14T04:09:06	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein of course, I worked down the hall from Mr. Ornstein at AEI when I first graduated from college
prchovanec	709229640053870592	2016-03-14T04:08:17	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein the perception of which was in many ways distorted by Newt's outsized public persona.
prchovanec	709229340811272196	2016-03-14T04:07:06	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein what I offered to do was clarify what they thought they were doing, and Newt's role in that.
prchovanec	709229105192030208	2016-03-14T04:06:10	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein I'm not presuming to convert any of you to like GOP, Newt, etc., that's impossible.
prchovanec	709228726601523200	2016-03-14T04:04:39	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein GOP ... but all anyone in this conversation seems to want to do is point fingers of blame.
prchovanec	709228575921143808	2016-03-14T04:04:03	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein GOP I'm trying to share non-judgmental reflections on the dynamics I saw at work ...
prchovanec	709228350120857601	2016-03-14T04:03:10	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein GOP alright, this is a useless conversation.
prchovanec	709228152116133888	2016-03-14T04:02:22	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein oh again with the "dog whistles". Republicans believed in welfare reform. Like it or not.
prchovanec	709227964211326976	2016-03-14T04:01:38	SoulRebelTO you keep saying "Newt" when I'm telling you there was a broad generational leadership.
prchovanec	709227769260068865	2016-03-14T04:00:51	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein that was the whole thrust of Triangulation. Claim credit for what he couldn't obstruct.
prchovanec	709227470155816961	2016-03-14T03:59:40	gonglei89 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein Clinton later bragged about signing welfare reforms Congress essentially forced him to accept.
prchovanec	709226880126341120	2016-03-14T03:57:19	Fullantho delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein there were a lot of other people driving, and anchoring, what was a generational movement.
prchovanec	709226535987847168	2016-03-14T03:55:57	Federalist_10 delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein again, I think the inordinate focus on Newt as leader ignores a generation of personalities.
prchovanec	709225981500907520	2016-03-14T03:53:45	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein Newt was central, no question, but there was a whole cadre (Armey, Delay, Kasich) that ran that Congress.
prchovanec	709225401000861696	2016-03-14T03:51:27	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein I think you, like most people, are inordinately focused on the personality of Newt.
prchovanec	709225080979656704	2016-03-14T03:50:10	haywire98 aarontimms HeerJeet oh, but he does. I knew him in college, we were in many classes together. He does.
prchovanec	709224896245731328	2016-03-14T03:49:26	haywire98 aarontimms HeerJeet but he truly believes, which makes him fundamentally different than Trump. Good or bad, you decide.
prchovanec	709224662790742016	2016-03-14T03:48:31	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein I'm not going to excuse the current game of footsie. Actually my point is that Newt was always erratic.
prchovanec	709224397702361089	2016-03-14T03:47:27	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein actually, I was. I was in charge of internal commo, so I stayed when all but senior staff were dismissed.
prchovanec	709224059238805505	2016-03-14T03:46:07	SoulRebelTO you can dislike them all you want, but were you in the room?
prchovanec	709223935037087744	2016-03-14T03:45:37	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein I honestly can't speak to later, though my impression is that the focus drifted once solidly in power.
prchovanec	709223780082647041	2016-03-14T03:45:00	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein and I'm talking about the 104th and 105th Congresses here, not later.
prchovanec	709223642920570880	2016-03-14T03:44:27	delong dcg1114 NormOrnstein no, I meant the House Republican leadership's focus, which was often but not always Newt's.
prchovanec	709223444253163520	2016-03-14T03:43:40	haywire98 aarontimms HeerJeet Trump is a cynical manipulator. Cruz is very much a true believer.
prchovanec	709222909349388288	2016-03-14T03:41:32	haywire98 aarontimms HeerJeet you can dislike one or both of them, but I think Trump and Cruz operate off entirely different paradigms.
prchovanec	709222640049848320	2016-03-14T03:40:28	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein and I think that became much more true AFTER he became Speaker, than before (when he was throwing bombs).
prchovanec	709222409052749824	2016-03-14T03:39:33	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein Newt constantly said whatever was on his mind, but it wasn't always welcomed, or defining of priorities.
prchovanec	709221851218747392	2016-03-14T03:37:20	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein I've already said more than I should, but there's a big gap between what I saw and popular conceptions.
prchovanec	709221437740077058	2016-03-14T03:35:42	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein Newt occupied a key role, no doubt, but there were a lot of different personalities at play.
prchovanec	709221039520288768	2016-03-14T03:34:07	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein I remember all the internal leadership meetings as being VERY focused on policy.
prchovanec	709220621033590784	2016-03-14T03:32:27	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein that's a very important distinction, and an important thread that links Kasich then to Kasich today.
prchovanec	709220423792205824	2016-03-14T03:31:40	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein yes, Newt ushered in a more confrontational style than Michel. But focus was usually on policy, not identity.
prchovanec	709220080681406464	2016-03-14T03:30:18	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein there is a reason Maraniss' book is called "Tell Newt to Shut Up" 
prchovanec	709219805363093507	2016-03-14T03:29:12	dcg1114 delong NormOrnstein Gingrich was never very disciplined. Do you really think that was the core message of the Contract period?
prchovanec	709218792329617408	2016-03-14T03:25:11	BillBindc like Reagan or not, he cannot be accurately described as amoral in design (like Nixon), or a reactionary (like Wallace).
prchovanec	709218420164857856	2016-03-14T03:23:42	BillBindc what Nixon sought merely to use, Reagan implicity sought to reconcile, educate, redirect along new philosophical lines.
prchovanec	709217916290527232	2016-03-14T03:21:42	BillBindc furthermore, one must recognize transition between Nixon-style realpolitik and Reagan-style ideological conservatism.
prchovanec	709217163303895040	2016-03-14T03:18:43	BillBindc Nixon was very much a pragmatist, no doubt, but maybe he did US a favor by defusing/domesticating resentment that fueled Wallace.
prchovanec	709215426367111168	2016-03-14T03:11:48	BillBindc I'm describing a project. Whether it succeeded or not, even temporarily, is a separate question.
prchovanec	709214915689619457	2016-03-14T03:09:47	delong NormOrnstein pray give concrete examples, because as someone who helped give flesh &amp; blood to the Contract, I'd love to know.
prchovanec	709214309826629632	2016-03-14T03:07:22	BillBindc bottled it, constrained it (morally), educated it (ideologically), channeled it in more constructive channels.
prchovanec	709213778395660288	2016-03-14T03:05:15	One could argue Trump's emergence is not product of GOP Southern Strategy's political success, but of its eventual failure.
prchovanec	709212993012240384	2016-03-14T03:02:08	Alternatively: Nixon's Southern Strategy thankfully co-opted Wallace-type resentment, constrained its virulence.

prchovanec	708909786377658368	2016-03-13T06:57:18	Hinrich_77 rosetangy that's a bizarre analogy. In any case, everyone knows who the "good" and "bad" guys in those movies are.
prchovanec	708909353525518336	2016-03-13T06:55:35	Hinrich_77 rosetangy he says EVERYTHING. But in saying everything, he says a lot about himself, and the things he wouldn't NOT say.
prchovanec	708908911542329344	2016-03-13T06:53:50	Hinrich_77 rosetangy Trump's all about "Of course I don't like the devil, but you gotta admit the guy's got style. Real winner."

prchovanec	708906192811270144	2016-03-13T06:43:01	Hinrich_77 rosetangy so if the Nazis never happened, as an analogy, we could discuss "will to power" all the same.

prchovanec	708905702534856704	2016-03-13T06:41:04	Hinrich_77 rosetangy honestly, I don't think Trump even comprehends what you just said. Doesn't know, doesn't care. Admires the strong.

prchovanec	708904711659905025	2016-03-13T06:37:08	Hinrich_77 rosetangy in this context the negatives preceding the big BUT lose all their meaning. They pale in the face of so much winning.
prchovanec	708904299628253188	2016-03-13T06:35:30	Hinrich_77 rosetangy which, btw, is pretty much exactly what he also said of Kim Jong-un. He's terrible, but you gotta give him credit!
prchovanec	708904142929059840	2016-03-13T06:34:53	Hinrich_77 rosetangy Trump's remarks on Putin are of the same "he's terrible, BUT you really gotta admire him, he's strong/wins" vein.
prchovanec	708903804100599808	2016-03-13T06:33:32	Hinrich_77 rosetangy what's relevant is how strikingly similar these comments are to Trump's more recent statements about Putin.
prchovanec	708903507471024128	2016-03-13T06:32:21	Hinrich_77 rosetangy anyone then or now would read Trump's point as: Russians weak/losers, China strong/winners, US weak/losers. No?
prchovanec	708903253682102272	2016-03-13T06:31:21	Hinrich_77 rosetangy it is hard to read this as anything other than a statement of admiration, despite the oh-so-regretable cost.
prchovanec	708903089789669376	2016-03-13T06:30:42	Hinrich_77 rosetangy "this shows the power of strength" in contrast to Gorbachev's weakness and US weakness.
prchovanec	708902921522446336	2016-03-13T06:30:01	Hinrich_77 rosetangy they were "horrible, vicious" BUT -- aha, but -- this was redeemed by putting it down (aka "winning")
prchovanec	708902601157427200	2016-03-13T06:28:45	Hinrich_77 rosetangy I can only infer they "almost blew it" by being too lenient, like Gorbachev, in contrast to their eventual crackdown.
prchovanec	708902196939767808	2016-03-13T06:27:09	Hinrich_77 rosetangy let's analyze the statement: "The Chinese government almost blew it". How, exactly?
prchovanec	708901651160158208	2016-03-13T06:24:59	GrayConnolly In 1990s, I didn't see much rural resentment of city-dwellers. I saw people wanting to move to and work in the cities.
prchovanec	708901253003288576	2016-03-13T06:23:24	GrayConnolly #2 many students were likely of rural origin as well.
prchovanec	708901081422680064	2016-03-13T06:22:43	GrayConnolly #1 I think you're forgetting the high prestige of students in Chinese culture, urban and rural alike.
prchovanec	708900763494387712	2016-03-13T06:21:27	Hinrich_77 rosetangy realDonaldTrump every person is free to come to what judgment they can in his always amorphous and conflicting words
prchovanec	708900400691355648	2016-03-13T06:20:00	GrayConnolly and over time, memories faded in both rural and urban China because nobody talked about it, nothing to gain by remembering.
prchovanec	708900227198132224	2016-03-13T06:19:19	GrayConnolly to the extent they supported government, it was because they had only been told govt version, not resentment at urbanites.
prchovanec	708900048516608000	2016-03-13T06:18:36	GrayConnolly but there were also a lot of people, especially in rural areas, who only had hearsay knowledge of what happened.
prchovanec	708899885366558720	2016-03-13T06:17:58	GrayConnolly in 1992, people would still come up to me and whisper "We have a bad government. You know what happened, right?"
prchovanec	708899516167168000	2016-03-13T06:16:30	GrayConnolly I talked to a lot of people in rural areas in the years following 1989, and I never once picked up such a vibe. Never once.
prchovanec	708899356460584960	2016-03-13T06:15:51	Hinrich_77 rosetangy realDonaldTrump the infamous "horrible but" that Trump uses ... that master of passive "who me?" endorsement.
prchovanec	708898998342565889	2016-03-13T06:14:26	GrayConnolly what I think drove split was different levels of prior exposure to what was, by then, months-long protests.
prchovanec	708898769883029504	2016-03-13T06:13:32	GrayConnolly I'm not saying there was no gap between rural and urban levels of loyalty, but I don't think it drove split in PLA.
prchovanec	708898107937972225	2016-03-13T06:10:54	GrayConnolly the later units (who had no prior interaction) were told there was an armed insurrection happening and to go in guns blazing.
prchovanec	708897848243396608	2016-03-13T06:09:52	GrayConnolly the early units didn't have orders to open fire, and were then tainted by interaction with the populace.
prchovanec	708897398714667008	2016-03-13T06:08:05	GrayConnolly the difference was that the Beijing units had more situational and personal awareness of what was actually going on.
prchovanec	708896967125028864	2016-03-13T06:06:22	GrayConnolly the Beijing units that had proven unreliable were no more "urban" in origin than the ones brought in.
prchovanec	708896624228044800	2016-03-13T06:05:00	Hinrich_77 rosetangy realDonaldTrump Playboy interview, at the time. And being protectionist doesn't make you informed critic of China.
prchovanec	708896364529328128	2016-03-13T06:03:58	GrayConnolly I know people speculated the "loyal peasants" argument at the time, but the docs that have surfaced don't really talk about it
prchovanec	708896058827476992	2016-03-13T06:02:45	GrayConnolly they would act based on info given to them, not based on any person knowledge/interaction with the protests.
prchovanec	708895812273770496	2016-03-13T06:01:46	GrayConnolly no, they just were presumed to be more loyal because they had no info that would lead them not to be.
prchovanec	708895627212660736	2016-03-13T06:01:02	GrayConnolly but contact/interaction I'm talking about isn't "urban affinity", it's that some units were disarmed/turned back/propagandized
prchovanec	708895297833984000	2016-03-13T05:59:44	GrayConnolly they also had issues at the command levels of some units, There were some officer-level mutinies.
prchovanec	708894984867606528	2016-03-13T05:58:29	GrayConnolly they brought in units that had not been "tainted" by contact/interaction with Beijing residents or students.
prchovanec	708894627735150592	2016-03-13T05:57:04	GrayConnolly they brought in units based outside Beijing. Virtually all the troops in the PLA (incl Beijing) at the time were "rural".
prchovanec	708894239887859712	2016-03-13T05:55:32	GrayConnolly there are a lot of facts not in evidence here.
prchovanec	708894106211258368	2016-03-13T05:55:00	GrayConnolly I'm not sure what you mean, exactly.
prchovanec	708893431255400448	2016-03-13T05:52:19	GrayConnolly they acted based on what they were told. And I'm not sure rural/urban origin was any different than Beijing units that turned.
prchovanec	708893077902106624	2016-03-13T05:50:55	GrayConnolly rural pop did benefit from '80s reforms, not as hit by inflation as urban pop. But I'm still not buying "loyal yeomanry".
prchovanec	708892134200496128	2016-03-13T05:47:10	GrayConnolly btw, I think it's possible to admire Deng for the good things he did, yet deplore this as an unnecessary and horrific mistake.
prchovanec	708891747204636672	2016-03-13T05:45:37	GrayConnolly it's worth noting that we know more now than we did at the time, when there was a great deal of speculation.
prchovanec	708891380278497280	2016-03-13T05:44:10	GrayConnolly I think it had a lot more to do with fact that outside units were told Beijing was in a state of armed insurrection.
prchovanec	708891053215109120	2016-03-13T05:42:52	GrayConnolly but I think it grossly overstates things to say rural troops consciously lacked sympathy for students due to class envy.
prchovanec	708890670803640320	2016-03-13T05:41:21	GrayConnolly and I'm not saying there wasn't something of an urban/rural gap at the time in terms of perceptions of the party.
prchovanec	708890497570492416	2016-03-13T05:40:39	GrayConnolly well, I think different people formed different impressions of what was taking place.
prchovanec	708889781866987520	2016-03-13T05:37:49	GrayConnolly anyway, the bloodies battles weren't with the students, they were with Beijing residents.
prchovanec	708889521983791104	2016-03-13T05:36:47	GrayConnolly it wasn't that they disliked the students, it's that they didn't know and were misinformed about what was even going on.
prchovanec	708888562050199552	2016-03-13T05:32:58	GrayConnolly oh, if this were isolated ... if this were the only sin ... then sure. No, it's part of a pattern, a worldview if you will.
prchovanec	708888259422650368	2016-03-13T05:31:46	GrayConnolly actually, the earliest troops turned back. Others were brought in and told there was a counter-revolution taking place.
prchovanec	708888044796047360	2016-03-13T05:30:55	GrayConnolly it was probably more widely shared at the time than now. And history's complexities don't absolves us of all moral judgment.
prchovanec	708887538715459584	2016-03-13T05:28:54	GrayConnolly in fact, standing up for our values, in an effectual way, actually demands such a clear-eyed relationship.
prchovanec	708887241062481920	2016-03-13T05:27:43	GrayConnolly but no, I see no inherent moral conflict between standing up for our values and having a pragmatic relationship with China.
prchovanec	708886658175901696	2016-03-13T05:25:24	GrayConnolly Sometimes people need to be reminded. So what?
prchovanec	708885979357126656	2016-03-13T05:22:42	GrayConnolly it's a moment in history that deeply informs my own values. Sorry if I can't be fashionably cynical about it.
prchovanec	708885105331314689	2016-03-13T05:19:14	GrayConnolly I'm not sure what you mean. But I know I have a lot more at stake in this issue than you do.
prchovanec	708884870823542784	2016-03-13T05:18:18	GrayConnolly then you should have stopped me before I live-tweeted the whole thing day-by-day, hour-by-hour in 2014.
prchovanec	708884410725171201	2016-03-13T05:16:28	GrayConnolly more than that, continuing to engage China was the right decision, for us and for them.
prchovanec	708884006851444736	2016-03-13T05:14:52	GrayConnolly nothing was business-as-usual after Tiananmen, but neither could US simply shut the door and pretend China didn't exist.
prchovanec	708883378544766976	2016-03-13T05:12:22	GrayConnolly they absolutely did NOT take the same view, nor ever did they voice such a view.

prchovanec	708119246367227904	2016-03-11T02:35:59	No, I really don't. If I went on TV and said US GDP growth was "zero" last quarter, I wouldn't be invited back. 
prchovanec	708118315168825344	2016-03-11T02:32:17	Oh, that's right, cite false statistics and then have people interpret what you "really" meant. 
prchovanec	708118071886684161	2016-03-11T02:31:19	Right, it's demagoguery, pure and simple. 
prchovanec	708117805720334336	2016-03-11T02:30:15	Also, many economists seriously doubt that China's GDP growth was 7% last year. Many think it was closer to 3-4%, some even less.

prchovanec	708112624760844288	2016-03-11T02:09:40	Bfklin 1) I think you underestimate the challenge, 2) this structural surplus is why I argue China should defend RMB, not devalue.

prchovanec	708104273440153602	2016-03-11T01:36:29	Well, one more person I once respected ... 
prchovanec	708103019938910216	2016-03-11T01:31:30	JacksonDiehl ChuckLane1 which is why he praised the Tiananmen crackdown and has never stopped rattling on about the Japanese.
prchovanec	708102583655780352	2016-03-11T01:29:46	JacksonDiehl ChuckLane1 the thing is, even back in 1991, Trump thought we were losing to everyone.
prchovanec	708101960109592582	2016-03-11T01:27:17	A large part of this, I suspect, is that China just wants to punish foreign shorts. 
prchovanec	708101606395478016	2016-03-11T01:25:53	Trump's recent remarks on China's currency are fundamentally unmoored to current economic and market reality.

prchovanec	708098256715304960	2016-03-11T01:12:34	RBirtel jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein which is what politicians actually THOUGHT they were doing, but obviously got it wrong.
prchovanec	708098085432500224	2016-03-11T01:11:54	RBirtel jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein the solution would have required a complete rethinking of bank regulation, not keeping G-S.
prchovanec	708097735115857921	2016-03-11T01:10:30	jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein RBirtel Glass-Steagall wasn't the finger in the dike, it was roadkill by the side of the road.
prchovanec	708097326921990144	2016-03-11T01:08:53	jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein RBirtel Regulation Q wasn't abandoned from ideology, the changes inflation wrought made it untenable.
prchovanec	708097023942238208	2016-03-11T01:07:40	jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein RBirtel that, btw, is why I began this conversation asking Rudy if he wanted to reinstate Regulation Q.
prchovanec	708096831994109952	2016-03-11T01:06:55	jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein RBirtel 1970s inflation spawned all kinds of changes and responses that gathered increasing momentum.
prchovanec	708096585889128449	2016-03-11T01:05:56	jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein RBirtel if you want to get down to it, what "unmoored" our banking system was 1970s inflation.
prchovanec	708096405336956928	2016-03-11T01:05:13	jchrisgillespie RudyHavenstein RBirtel because repeal REFLECTED rather than caused markets outstripping the existing regulatory framework
prchovanec	708096126231171072	2016-03-11T01:04:06	RudyHavenstein RBirtel which is that people ascribe to Glass-Steagall a kind of totemic significance unjustified by specific cause-effect.
prchovanec	708095796391108608	2016-03-11T01:02:48	RudyHavenstein RBirtel precisely, so I'm not carrying water for anyone, just saying what I actually think.
prchovanec	708095586352963586	2016-03-11T01:01:58	RudyHavenstein RBirtel people go "oh, we repealed this law, banks got big, and bad things happen" w/o delineating any real causality.
prchovanec	708095155211993088	2016-03-11T01:00:15	RudyHavenstein RBirtel I wasn't "defending" repeal, I was saying it was irrelevant to 2008 crisis. People treat it as totemic cause.
prchovanec	708094820313636864	2016-03-11T00:58:55	RudyHavenstein RBirtel and I don't think it would have prevented very much of what did happen.
prchovanec	708094717813256192	2016-03-11T00:58:31	RudyHavenstein RBirtel well, you just look at Glass-Steagall firewall and ask exactly what it would have prevented, or not.
prchovanec	708094547599998976	2016-03-11T00:57:50	RBirtel RudyHavenstein the problem wasn't deregulation, it was a new set of circumstances outstripping the existing regulatory structure.
prchovanec	708094180946481153	2016-03-11T00:56:23	RBirtel RudyHavenstein "if we had never repealed Glass-Steagall" ... the same damn thing would have happened, pretty much the same way.
prchovanec	708093896480460800	2016-03-11T00:55:15	RBirtel RudyHavenstein I agree the principles have application, but the problems and solutions (incl G-S) are apples &amp; oranges then vs now
prchovanec	708093719900262400	2016-03-11T00:54:33	RBirtel RudyHavenstein I think you're applying the principles that animated Pecora to a set of issues he was not dealing with at the time.
prchovanec	708093545933119488	2016-03-11T00:53:51	RudyHavenstein RBirtel that sort of begs the question, to what effect? And I don't think the answer is obvious.
prchovanec	708093293192679424	2016-03-11T00:52:51	RBirtel RudyHavenstein explain.
prchovanec	708093193049513984	2016-03-11T00:52:27	RBirtel RudyHavenstein Citi's rationale? diversification, one-stop "supermarket", *maybe* access to capital but I'm not sure that holds.
prchovanec	708092945614966785	2016-03-11T00:51:28	RBirtel RudyHavenstein that's a very good question, which is why most of them didn't (before Fed forced them to).
prchovanec	708091835256799232	2016-03-11T00:47:03	RBirtel RudyHavenstein but the growing complexity was inherent even in pure investment banks, not in merging of C&amp;I banking per se.
prchovanec	708091491596574721	2016-03-11T00:45:41	RBirtel RudyHavenstein I'm talking about Reed's interview, sorry.
prchovanec	708091417839669248	2016-03-11T00:45:24	RudyHavenstein RBirtel Manish_05Singh I'm using "evolved" in a value-neutral sense. Evolved as in mutated, changed.
prchovanec	708091301841997824	2016-03-11T00:44:56	RudyHavenstein RBirtel Manish_05Singh it wasn't so much a tearing down of old regulations as their growing impotency in face of change.
prchovanec	708090703419678720	2016-03-11T00:42:34	RudyHavenstein RBirtel Manish_05Singh my view? the market evolved beyond the point where banks OR regulators knew what was happening.
prchovanec	708090401358553088	2016-03-11T00:41:22	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel all I heard was a magical leap from repeal to bad things happening, with no clear causality.
prchovanec	708090096612941825	2016-03-11T00:40:09	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel and I never, in that 15 minutes, heard him explain (as opposed to imply) that connection.
prchovanec	708089817083592704	2016-03-11T00:39:02	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel anyway, I was really hoping Reed would explain connection between Glass-Steagall and bad stuff ...
prchovanec	708089205335920641	2016-03-11T00:36:36	RBirtel Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein there were plenty of things that went wrong, and Glass-Steagall is a red herring.
prchovanec	708089104534282241	2016-03-11T00:36:12	RBirtel Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein I think you guys ascribe some kind of magical qualities to Glass-Steagall firewall it never had.
prchovanec	708088835750686720	2016-03-11T00:35:08	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel This is totemistic thinking. What exact practice would Glass-Steagall have prevented?
prchovanec	708088625821523968	2016-03-11T00:34:18	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel and the bigness of banks wasn't the problem, really, it was their unprecedented interdependence.
prchovanec	708088404966252544	2016-03-11T00:33:26	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel gotta tell you, big banks were already being formed well before Glass-Steagall was repealed.
prchovanec	708088153115107328	2016-03-11T00:32:26	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel which is why many of the firms that ran into trouble were NOT merged entities at all.
prchovanec	708087954774876160	2016-03-11T00:31:38	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel the problem lay in the practices of investment banks, not their merger with commercial banks.
prchovanec	708087732250218496	2016-03-11T00:30:45	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel how would Glass-Steagall firewall have prevented the securitization of no-doc mortgages?
prchovanec	708087185338142720	2016-03-11T00:28:35	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel which is the problem: people use Glass-Steagall repeal as a totem w/o understanding what it did.
prchovanec	708086992215666689	2016-03-11T00:27:49	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel video asserts a causality that it never bothers to take time to delineate in any convincing detail.
prchovanec	708086564287594496	2016-03-11T00:26:07	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel it really doesn't. I just watched it and they're talking past Glass-Steagall, not about it.
prchovanec	708086351753777152	2016-03-11T00:25:16	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel they're making logical leaps from totem of Glass-Steagall to outcomes unrelated to its provisions.
prchovanec	708086052406300672	2016-03-11T00:24:05	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel I've yet to hear anything in first 10 minutes related to the actual provisions of Glass-Steagall
prchovanec	708085568014520321	2016-03-11T00:22:09	RudyHavenstein RBirtel so we're talking about Glass-Steagall, not a particular politicians, good or bad.
prchovanec	708085398279430145	2016-03-11T00:21:29	Manish_05Singh RudyHavenstein RBirtel yeah, PLEASE EXPLAIN IN DETAIL how Glass-Steagall provision were relevant. Should be easy request.
prchovanec	708084181495115780	2016-03-11T00:16:39	RudyHavenstein RBirtel you made an assertion, I did not.
prchovanec	708083654224965633	2016-03-11T00:14:33	RBirtel RudyHavenstein what practices or forms of organization that caused 2008 crisis would unrepealed Glass-Steagall have prevented?
prchovanec	708083166511304705	2016-03-11T00:12:37	RBirtel RudyHavenstein did securities firms push the stock of their own parent banks onto bank customers?
prchovanec	708082872498954240	2016-03-11T00:11:27	RudyHavenstein RBirtel then it should be easy to give examples of what practices Glass-Steagall would have prevented that led to 2008.
prchovanec	708082385750007810	2016-03-11T00:09:30	RBirtel RudyHavenstein for instance, did investment banks push securities meant to pay off loans made by their parent companies?
prchovanec	708081064506429440	2016-03-11T00:04:15	RBirtel RudyHavenstein and I don't mean separate failures of each kind of bank, I mean conflict from having them both under the same roof.
prchovanec	708079661625024513	2016-03-10T23:58:41	RBirtel RudyHavenstein please elaborate on the precise conflicts of interest between commercial and investment banking that took place.
prchovanec	708078927756062720	2016-03-10T23:55:46	RBirtel RudyHavenstein if you are correct, it would make for an excellent article. I'm all ears.

prchovanec	708011818774601728	2016-03-10T19:29:06	RudyHavenstein the issues raised by the Pecora hearings, which served as the basis for Glass-Steagall, just weren't the problem in 2008.
prchovanec	708011579556700160	2016-03-10T19:28:09	RudyHavenstein obsessing about Glass-Steagall is such form over substance. There were and are real issues. G-S wasn't one of them.

prchovanec	708002988271538176	2016-03-10T18:54:01	scottlincicome let's dance. 
prchovanec	708002570502017024	2016-03-10T18:52:21	Wolf_InTheWilds yes, that's absolutely true. And they can only do so if someone is willing to finance their trade deficit.
prchovanec	708002342818422784	2016-03-10T18:51:27	Wolf_InTheWilds yes, it's the sustainability that is the issue. And "competitiveness' cuts both ways. Doesn't determine trade balance.
prchovanec	708002130502819842	2016-03-10T18:50:36	scottlincicome okay, well we shouldn't quibble because we basically agree.
prchovanec	708002000814919681	2016-03-10T18:50:05	Wolf_InTheWilds again, I would emphasize MIGHT, because history is replete with fast-growing nations financing growth via trade deficits.
prchovanec	708001677345947648	2016-03-10T18:48:48	Wolf_InTheWilds but it's the decision to borrow or to lend that facilitates a trade imbalance. Without it, no imbalance is possible.
prchovanec	708001557565067264	2016-03-10T18:48:20	Wolf_InTheWilds I can understand why a less competitive country might WANT to borrow, and why a more competitive one might WANT to lend.

prchovanec	708000140397842432	2016-03-10T18:42:42	scottlincicome well, sustainability of global trade imbalances IS a legitimate question.
prchovanec	707999886940180480	2016-03-10T18:41:41	Wolf_InTheWilds okay, we've had this conversation before. Differences in competitiveness do NOT imply an imbalance in trade.
prchovanec	707999529853960192	2016-03-10T18:40:16	scottlincicome Pew generally does good polling, and to be fair, I didn't read the piece, just making an observation.
