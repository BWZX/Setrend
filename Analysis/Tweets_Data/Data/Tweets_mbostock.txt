mbostock	725402890861481984	2016-04-27T19:15:01	MarkHintz Exactly. Though often you also have gravity and other forces, too. See Jakobsen: 
mbostock	725402497259569152	2016-04-27T19:13:27	MarkHintz Actually, that centering force is superfluous. But the repulsive force is necessary; otherwise trivially solved with overlap.

mbostock	708080867554361345	2016-03-11T00:03:28	veltman Agree there‚Äôs totally a role for errors. Like, array.forEach(42) should and does throw, rather than doing nothing.

mbostock	708065337208508416	2016-03-10T23:01:46	veltman I sometimes favor well-defined deterministic behavior over trying to catch and throw for all possible error conditions.

mbostock	708064310530945024	2016-03-10T22:57:41	FogleBird Also, selection.merge can be used to union filtered selections, and maybe other uses. It‚Äôs seems more orthogonal (to me).
mbostock	708064040526827521	2016-03-10T22:56:37	FogleBird So a selection can‚Äôt have a reference to the appended selection; it doesn‚Äôt exist yet (and selections are immutable).
mbostock	708063788747005952	2016-03-10T22:55:37	FogleBird The enter selection and the selection you append to it aren‚Äôt the same thing. (I sometimes call the latter ‚Äúmaterialized‚Äù enter.)

mbostock	695458075059187712	2016-02-05T04:05:00	veltman Another abstraction is probably needed‚Äîlike how CSS has both animations and transitions.
mbostock	695457948990992384	2016-02-05T04:04:30	veltman Transitions are implicit (typically just declare end state) and destructive (delete state on execution).

mbostock	692475596094476288	2016-01-27T22:33:42	trek Yes, there are a few ways Bower could fix this. GH releases or npm integration would work for me.

mbostock	692204466179809280	2016-01-27T04:36:19	tswicegood Haven‚Äôt thought about that. Mostly thinking about front-end dev, and just the UX/security/philosophy around packaging.

mbostock	692203094868901888	2016-01-27T04:30:52	tswicegood My take was that grhmc felt any automatic action (even if visible) was too dangerous.
mbostock	692202805172506624	2016-01-27T04:29:43	tswicegood grhmc CaseySoftware It was always explicit in saying what it was doing, but you actually had to watch what it was doing.

mbostock	692094585124696065	2016-01-26T21:19:42	herrstucki Yes, and Crom could install from npm too. Per other tweet, the important thing is dependencies are declared as URLs.
mbostock	692094376961441792	2016-01-26T21:18:52	herrstucki jspm (and others) have extensible registries, but the critical thing is getting people to declare deps as URLs, not names.
mbostock	692093756401537026	2016-01-26T21:16:24	herrstucki E.g., the package URL is just a JSON file that lists the releases (versions &amp; corresponding ZIP URL).
mbostock	692093529464569859	2016-01-26T21:15:30	luiscarli herrstucki No, because Crom isn‚Äôt pushing any centralized registry: packages are referenced by URLs and can live anywhere.
mbostock	692092551470252035	2016-01-26T21:11:37	herrstucki Crom isn‚Äôt specific to GitHub releases. (The implementation currently is, but the idea isn‚Äôt.)
mbostock	692092445962547207	2016-01-26T21:11:12	herrstucki I (the package author) chose GitHub. You can chose whatever you want, or a mirror, if you prefer.
mbostock	692092171273375748	2016-01-26T21:10:06	More thoughts on Crom, including metadata, URLs and content-addressable storage. 
mbostock	692091184957648898	2016-01-26T21:06:11	herrstucki I feel the opposite: publishing to multiple registries now is a big pain. GitHub should be sufficient.
mbostock	692089627633528832	2016-01-26T21:00:00	herrstucki That expresses the value of a stable mirror, but shouldn‚Äôt place an onus on package authors (and other users).
mbostock	692088824810242048	2016-01-26T20:56:48	herrstucki You‚Äôre giving package owners control (rather than registry owners) with decentralization, certainly.
mbostock	692086402276683776	2016-01-26T20:47:11	herrstucki Bower has a registry. And has no way of publishing generated files (other than checking them into git).
mbostock	692067149515345920	2016-01-26T19:30:41	ParagonSci_Inc KirkDBorne It‚Äôs by BlackiLi.
mbostock	692054921424666625	2016-01-26T18:42:05	joepie91 But you‚Äôre saying the solution is that we all have to use the same (fixed) host?
mbostock	692054708056240128	2016-01-26T18:41:14	joepie91 The only difference with Crom is that the name is replaced with a URL, which provides a decentralized way of listing releases.
mbostock	692054402832568320	2016-01-26T18:40:02	joepie91 Right, but Crom still uses semver, so I don‚Äôt see the problem‚Ä¶
mbostock	692053685912776708	2016-01-26T18:37:11	joepie91 You don‚Äôt lose that property. You have determinism if you want an exact match, and otherwise you can use version ranges.
mbostock	692053486934962176	2016-01-26T18:36:23	joepie91 Sure, but if you‚Äôre not specifying an exact version, then it‚Äôs already nondeterministic, right?
mbostock	692053311034257408	2016-01-26T18:35:41	joepie91 The hash applies to an exact version, yes.
mbostock	692053003252072448	2016-01-26T18:34:28	joepie91 I don‚Äôt see how content hashes and redirects aren‚Äôt sufficient to satisfy the problems you describe.
mbostock	692052556537671680	2016-01-26T18:32:41	joepie91 Seems like you‚Äôve already made your mind up, but I still think it‚Äôs worth thinking about decentralization.
mbostock	692050265176829953	2016-01-26T18:23:35	joepie91 npm deprecate also does a poor job of facilitating package renaming, which is also a UX stink. ;)
mbostock	692049609191878657	2016-01-26T18:20:59	joepie91 If we‚Äôre free to change hosting providers, why should we be tied to a fixed, centralized registry?
mbostock	692048947871780866	2016-01-26T18:18:21	joepie91 You could have proxies that take immutable snapshots of published packages if you want to opt-in to centralized management.
mbostock	692047902961602560	2016-01-26T18:14:12	joepie91 How is forcing everyone to (effectively) use  any better?
mbostock	692047462270312448	2016-01-26T18:12:27	joepie91 You could use redirects to allow package authors to change hosts, or have users re-search for new URLs.
mbostock	692046913860833280	2016-01-26T18:10:16	joepie91 Search terms are immediately expanded to URLs and saved to metadata. 
mbostock	692026689690316800	2016-01-26T16:49:54	aidanskinner joeshaw The stars are only used in the initial search. Subsequently the dependency is defined as a URL (+ SHA).
mbostock	692023656520634368	2016-01-26T16:37:51	somebitsLinks Hey, don‚Äôt knock it! 
mbostock	692023321274114049	2016-01-26T16:36:31	_sequoia Not quite because I still want my package manager to be able to discover versions and update.
mbostock	692023165506027520	2016-01-26T16:35:54	_sequoia With that, you could opt-in to using npm‚Äôs centralized registry, but you wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúpunished‚Äù for not doing so.
mbostock	692022957787340800	2016-01-26T16:35:04	_sequoia Then, the npm client should expand names to URLs when modifying the package.json.
mbostock	692022811376746496	2016-01-26T16:34:30	_sequoia It‚Äôd be best to define an RSS-like format for defining a project‚Äôs published versions, so they can be published anywhere.
mbostock	692021570705821696	2016-01-26T16:29:34	_sequoia I know, I just started yesterday! Lots to do.
mbostock	692020873109213185	2016-01-26T16:26:47	_sequoia Haha, that would be bad. :)
mbostock	692020750664884224	2016-01-26T16:26:18	_sequoia And separate URLs for projects (for discovering versions) from releases (fixed content).
mbostock	692020541432033280	2016-01-26T16:25:28	_sequoia Not git, because releases have generated files. ZIP archives (or tarballs).
mbostock	692019245874458624	2016-01-26T16:20:19	_sequoia So, a package defines its dependencies explicitly, even if on the command line you weren't initially explicit.
mbostock	692019055193038849	2016-01-26T16:19:34	_sequoia The idea is that the names are just a search query that is then bound to a URL. So ranking heuristics can improve over time.
mbostock	691999869485977600	2016-01-26T15:03:20	chrtze stekhn Bower requires a registry (for short names) and requires checking generated files into git.
mbostock	691999507454627841	2016-01-26T15:01:53	ed_davies Exactly.
mbostock	691853769882079233	2016-01-26T05:22:47	kejadlen Yes.

mbostock	691810515295850497	2016-01-26T02:30:54	mtiller With search the names are not canonical; they can change and have local meaning.
mbostock	691810363088715776	2016-01-26T02:30:18	mtiller It‚Äôs subtle but there‚Äôs a difference between searching and using a repository.
mbostock	691800373191929856	2016-01-26T01:50:36	trakz Can you elaborate? That sounds interesting.
mbostock	691799867165949952	2016-01-26T01:48:36	mtiller That seems like it still has a centralized registry (albeit on GitHub).
mbostock	691798931274080256	2016-01-26T01:44:52	msjgriffiths It‚Äôs subtle to design, but the usability of the tool has a big influence on how it ends up being used.
mbostock	691798495775293440	2016-01-26T01:43:09	msjgriffiths Also `crom install [query]` actually installs, not searches. This is ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù, but easily undone. So, convenient.
mbostock	691797344896053248	2016-01-26T01:38:34	msjgriffiths Seems a key difference is that, in Crom, names aren‚Äôt canonical; they are search terms. Only URLs are canonical identifiers.
mbostock	691787475392552960	2016-01-26T00:59:21	msjgriffiths But it knows the -c pandas is ‚Äúthe Pandas channel on ‚Äù, no?
mbostock	691786821248929793	2016-01-26T00:56:45	msjgriffiths Is that not tied to ?
mbostock	691784665062100992	2016-01-26T00:48:11	colinmegill Yeah, but you can name-squat on usernames, too! But certainly, longer names are less likely to have conflicts.
mbostock	691783371349979136	2016-01-26T00:43:03	I wrote a script that downloads a ZIP file, AMA. 
mbostock	691783081049604096	2016-01-26T00:41:53	colinmegill The primacy of names and the name-squatting on npm is an issue. But URLs have that to a degree with domain squatting. :)
mbostock	691782737523507204	2016-01-26T00:40:31	colinmegill No, it‚Äôs more of a philosophical qualm with npm. And an obsession with making smaller, decoupled tools.
mbostock	691779057508356096	2016-01-26T00:25:54	wagenet My beef with Bower is it doesn‚Äôt let me publish generated files and I refuse to put them in git. ;)
mbostock	691778775705612289	2016-01-26T00:24:47	james_t_webber That certainly looks related! I guess I‚Äôm primarily thinking of webdev, though.
mbostock	691777817055510528	2016-01-26T00:20:58	wagenet You wouldn‚Äôt rely on the short name; it‚Äôs an unsafe (but convenient) alias. It would auto-expand to URL. 
mbostock	691776981004894209	2016-01-26T00:17:39	wagenet The point is, a package manager could work with multiple registries (or arbitrary internet). GitHub is just a convenience.
mbostock	691776630864416768	2016-01-26T00:16:16	Bopuc 
mbostock	691776533401309185	2016-01-26T00:15:52	wagenet Sure, it could save a signature and verify it hasn‚Äôt changed. But what you describe doesn‚Äôt require centralization.
mbostock	691776017938169857	2016-01-26T00:13:49	wagenet Read the README. It‚Äôs not downloading the git repository, but published release assets (a ZIP you attach).
mbostock	691775770721685504	2016-01-26T00:12:50	wagenet If you don‚Äôt trust the author, you should be your choice to use a third party for your immutable snapshots.
mbostock	691775158038761475	2016-01-26T00:10:24	grayj_ I think git tags (&amp; GitHub releases) seem sufficient for defining versions? And imagining some package.json-equivalent for Crom.
mbostock	691774720044331009	2016-01-26T00:08:40	If you‚Äôre interested in making Crom a real thing, let me know. Also let me know if it already exists and I didn‚Äôt find it. ;)
mbostock	691774305420578820	2016-01-26T00:07:01	I‚Äôve spent all of an hour tinkering with Crom, but it‚Äôs an itch I‚Äôve had for years (most notably whenever the npm registry went down).
mbostock	691773565901934592	2016-01-26T00:04:05	I‚Äôd like a package manager decoupled from any package registry. My toy proof-of-concept: 
mbostock	691701445746233345	2016-01-25T19:17:30	maxgoldst Or, for one element, just this.classList.toggle("foo").
mbostock	691701178971738112	2016-01-25T19:16:26	maxgoldst If you can depend on classList (no SVG): selection.each(function() { this.classList.toggle("foo"); })
mbostock	691700691170041857	2016-01-25T19:14:30	maxgoldst Without a var: selection.classed("foo", function() { return !d3.select(this).classed("foo"); })

mbostock	691045408819122176	2016-01-23T23:50:39	WillemD Queue runs a batch of asynchronous tasks concurrently, but no more than N at a time, and then tells you when they‚Äôre all done.
mbostock	691045041456852992	2016-01-23T23:49:11	WillemD I think you could tweak the implementation a bit so that queue.defer took a Promise rather than a callback, for example.
mbostock	691044869184159746	2016-01-23T23:48:30	WillemD But Queue isn‚Äôt a replacement for Promises. It‚Äôs more like a connection pool or Promise.all with configurable concurrency.
mbostock	691044812565278720	2016-01-23T23:48:16	WillemD My point was that you need a wrapper to adapt callback-style APIs to use Promises, which adds to the complexity.

mbostock	690706676589047809	2016-01-23T01:24:39	ericbuth About what?
mbostock	690706389111431168	2016-01-23T01:23:30	ericbuth That‚Äôs an overly strict definition of ‚Äúparallel‚Äù, in my view. Even so, these tasks may sometimes meet that definition.
mbostock	690705190224171008	2016-01-23T01:18:44	ericbuth Parallelism seems like a fine word for the count of things, such as network requests, that happen concurrently.
mbostock	690704694759395328	2016-01-23T01:16:46	ericbuth I was trolling, but yes, it concurrency for asynchronous tasks, not threads or processes.
mbostock	690703564272889856	2016-01-23T01:12:17	ericbuth shancarter Yes. But you have to put "use threads"; at the top of your JS file.
mbostock	690702785646465024	2016-01-23T01:09:11	shancarter I should rename it d3-queue though.

mbostock	687785158867554306	2016-01-14T23:55:34	jods16 I dunno. Just imagining. Perhaps you could restrict the syntax so that named properties only appeared at the end.

mbostock	687338612929634304	2016-01-13T18:21:10	aredridel `npm tag d3@4.0.0-alpah.4 alpha` worked (albeit with a deprecation notice), thanks.
mbostock	687334536577847297	2016-01-13T18:04:58	aredridel Mind advising on how to retroactively apply the ‚Äúalpha‚Äù tag to the already-published prereleases?
mbostock	687327855865245696	2016-01-13T17:38:25	aredridel Maybe it‚Äôs fine if ‚Äúlatest‚Äù includes prereleases, but then ‚Äúlatest‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be the default tag (e.g., npm install d3).
mbostock	687327621957337088	2016-01-13T17:37:29	aredridel Okay, but that makes it sound like npm doesn‚Äôt support prereleases if everything is considered a ‚Äúrelease‚Äù. üòú
mbostock	687323543588089856	2016-01-13T17:21:17	emeyers615 Maybe use a named transition? The brush only interrupts default (empty name) transitions. 
mbostock	687322748054417408	2016-01-13T17:18:07	aredridel Why does the default ‚Äúlatest‚Äù include prereleases, then? Prerelease means ‚Äúbefore release‚Äù. Shouldn‚Äôt it be opt-in, not opt-out?
mbostock	687319287745282049	2016-01-13T17:04:22	aredridel kjeldahl If npmjs wants ‚Äúlatest‚Äù to include prereleases, wouldn‚Äôt a tag just make d3 behave in a nonstandard way?

mbostock	687291726952665089	2016-01-13T15:14:51	kjeldahl Also, sounds like you‚Äôre using the latest npmjs, which regrettably installs prereleases by default. Earlier versions didn‚Äôt.
mbostock	687291200156520448	2016-01-13T15:12:46	kjeldahl Yes, a new major version number indicates breaking API changes; never use ‚Äúlatest‚Äù if you want strict compatibility.
