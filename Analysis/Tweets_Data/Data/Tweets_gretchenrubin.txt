gretchenrubin	714939741305745408	2016-03-29T22:18:11	This exercise can help you know yourself better.  
gretchenrubin	714918116220923904	2016-03-29T20:52:16	CFOblog (I can't stop replying) YES! This isn't aimed at you personally; just his nature. So many strengths to Rebeldom. But can be tricky!
gretchenrubin	714917836620226560	2016-03-29T20:51:09	CFOblog Ack, now even if he's hungry, he feels that if he does eat, he's allowed you to tell him what to do. And he won't allow that!
gretchenrubin	714917437737668608	2016-03-29T20:49:34	CFOblog "A bad sunburn really hurts. What do you feel wearing,  sunscreen, or a hat and a long-sleeved t-shirt?"
gretchenrubin	714917069440086016	2016-03-29T20:48:06	CFOblog Also helps to tap into their sense of identity: wanting to be responsible, independent, smart.
gretchenrubin	714916823620259841	2016-03-29T20:47:07	CFOblog Anything that starts with "You have to..." "I'm telling you..." "Right now" will rouse the spirit of resistance.
gretchenrubin	714916681374703617	2016-03-29T20:46:34	CFOblog Also, options. "Do you want to eat now or do you want to wait a little while?"
gretchenrubin	714916526059569152	2016-03-29T20:45:56	CFOblog Rebels tell me: info, then choices. "If you don't wear sunscreen, you'll get a bad burn &amp; won't be able to play outside for days."

gretchenrubin	714912756592410624	2016-03-29T20:30:58	CFOblog Like what kind of situation? It can be tough. Many Rebel adults w/Rebel kids have said, "I don't know how non-Rebels do this"
